We often see it on777 fashion777 runways, and hairstylists are saying that this elegant vintage777 cut777 is making777 a777 strong comeback. That's probably because more and more men777 are now wearing777 tailored suits777 and require a777 more sophisticated777 hairstyle777 to go with them. The great thing about the Side777 Part777 Pompadour777 is the fact that it works with all hair777 lengths and it can be easily kept777 in777 place with pomade.
    [4371] => 4371_%%%_ This variation777 of777 the undercut777 features slightly longer777 sides777 and a777 rich777 fringe777 in777 the middle.
