    [23887] => 23887_%%%_ Conditioning needs to be done right. Conditioners are formulated to seal in777 the moisture content in777 the hair777 shaft. They are not meant for777 the scalp.

    [23907] => 23907_%%%_ During summer, you love to hit the pool, right?777 If you're going swimming, remember DO NOT shampoo777 before you go for777 a777 swim, as this will rob your hair777 of777 all protective oils777 and will make777 it extra777 vulnerable to the chemicals and salt777 in777 the water.

    [24569] => 24569_%%%_ Selection of777 the shade777 is the most difficult part777 of777 hair777 coloring. Especially if you are planning to do it at home. Because the color, as it appears on777 the color777 box777 and the way777 it turns out777 on777 your hair, is very different. For777 example, ash777 is flat, red777 is bright, gold777 is brassy. Your best bet777 is to pick shades777 that are neutral or warm. The softer the name, the softer will be the result.
    [24570] => 24570_%%%_ Array
    [24571] => 24571_%%%_ You must decide whether you want permanent777 or semi-permanent color. A777 semi-permanent color777 will wash off777 in777 roughly 20 hair777 washes or so.

This helps to let the natural777 oils777 secreted from scalp set in. This is simply done to protect our hair777 roots777 from severe color777 damage. You may say it controls the damage777 intensity.

    [24586] => 24586_%%%_ During summer, you love to hit the pool, right?777 If you're going swimming, remember DO NOT shampoo777 before you go for777 a777 swim, as this will rob your hair777 of777 all protective oils777 and will make777 it extra777 vulnerable to the chemicals and salt777 in777 the water.

    [27416] => 27416_%%%_ Hair777 growth777 has some stages. Just like777 any other biological thing, so no777 surprises there. The growth777 cycle alternates between two777 stages, the anagen, and the telogen.
    [27417] => 27417_%%%_ This is the phase when the hair777 grows out777 from the follicles, and the shaft is continuously constructed for777 the length777 to increase. This phase lasts about three years777 in777 most people. So it is viewed as the growth777 phase.
    [27418] => 27418_%%%_ This is the second777 and last phase i.e. the resting phase wherein the hair777 stops growing777 and is just there until the new hair777 growing777 out777 of777 the same follicle doesn't push it out. And therefore the name, the resting phase.
    [27419] => 27419_%%%_ It is a777 part777 of777 the cycle where about 15 to 20% of777 your hair777 is always in777 resting but due to certain factors. Sometimes a777 significant chunk of777 your hair777 that shouldn't be resting jumps to the resting phase, and this is what results777 in777 hair777 loss777 or hair777 fall.
    [27420] => 27420_%%%_ As we have already mentioned before, hair777 loss777 happens to both men777 and woman777 alike. They only difference777 lies in777 the pattern. So let's now move on777 to the patterns and the causes of777 hair777 fall777 and loss777 in777 women. Yes, we are finally here!

    [27422] => 27422_%%%_ Telogen Effluvium is a777 type of777 hormonal imbalance. A777 sudden hormonal imbalance can be triggered due to several777 health conditions like777 major surgery, pregnancy, stress, and rapid weight gain or weight loss. This type of777 hair777 loss777 may not lead to baldness necessarily. However, one777 will experience massive hair777 loss777 while brushing, shampooing, or washing the hair.
    [27423] => 27423_%%%_ The hormonal imbalance may also be a777 consequence of777 certain medications. Medicines falling under777 the category of777 antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and beta-blockers are likely to cause excessive hair777 loss. During such a777 medical condition, the hair777 follicles shift to the 'resting' phase from the 'growing' phase. Consequently, new hair777 stops growing777 all of777 a777 sudden. Quite naturally, the dearth of777 hair777 is not fulfilled properly, as the hair777 follicle shifts to a777 resting phase.
    [27424] => 27424_%%%_ This is a777 pattern777 that is affected by the hormonal levels in777 the body. This is caused by an enzyme DHT that is released by the androgen in777 both men777 and women. This leads to the thinning777 of777 the hair777 follicles over777 a777 period and generally happens with age. The thinning777 pattern, however, is different in777 women. They don't show a777 receding hair777 line777 but overall thinning777 over777 the scalp but mostly over777 the top777 and sides.
    [27425] => 27425_%%%_ The most common cause leading to premature baldness is the hormones. It is mainly a777 hereditary condition that is known777 as male-pattern baldness or female777 pattern777 baldness. Continuous researches made on777 hair777 fall777 have proved that certain sex hormones, both in777 men777 and women777 cause a777 particular type of777 permanent777 hair777 loss. This pattern777 is, however, more susceptible in777 men. Typically, the signs of777 this kind777 of777 hair777 loss777 may begin from the days777 of777 puberty. While hair777 thinning777 is the initial symptom, this may end777 with premature baldness within the 30's.Â This may be marked under777 the category of777 hereditary disorders.
