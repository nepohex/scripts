    [14207] => 14207_%%%_ It is thick777 at the midway of777 the falling hair. This gives it an attractive roundness only broken777 at the forehead. Bundles of777 strands777 are not combed777 to uniformity as they are left777 to form777 layers777 over777 each other.
    [14208] => 14208_%%%_ Bundles of777 strands777 interlace over777 each other and you would not clearly define777 what the stylist wanted to achieve. But that is the mystery in777 this style that would compel you to choose it. It is rough towards the ends777 and falls longer777 at the front.
    [14209] => 14209_%%%_ The hair777 falls from the crown777 and fully obscures one777 side777 of777 the ear777 and partly the eye. It is thick777 and smooth777 but ends777 with sharp777 tips that seem like777 glued to the neck777 region. For777 casual777 or formal777 functions you have your beauty taken care of777 so you do not have to worry what others777 will see in777 you.
    [14210] => 14210_%%%_ If you look777 carefully, there is a777 golden777 yellow777 glow at hair777 tips at the back. They are the eye-catching point777 of777 the creation. The hair777 drops to the back777 and the sides777 and keeps away777 from touching the shoulders. The forehead777 is left777 untouched by a777 single777 strand777 and you can see the lady's beauty in777 every angle.
    [14211] => 14211_%%%_ The hair777 is light777 white777 but not that deep777 in777 color. It is gray777 at the tips to add777 to the play of777 colors. It falls thick777 from one777 half777 and it is impressive with the fine777 comb777 tooth that has given it a777 smooth777 finish. There is an intention to trim777 it at the tips and that achieves a777 blunt777 look777 which makes it a777 super bob.
    [14212] => 14212_%%%_ It is a777 medium777 size777 that will be a777 ready-to-go style for777 the office777 lady. A777 big portion777 of777 the hair777 is drawn towards the back777 and it lies over777 the back777 neck777 slightly above the blouse collar. At one777 side777 there is a777 fall777 that is aesthetically treated to long777 bangs. The other side777 is tilted towards the back777 and it makes contrasting777 waves.
    [14213] => 14213_%%%_ One777 side777 is dropped to what seems to be single777 wide777 bangs777 that extend from the forehead777 to the half777 of777 the back. It obscures one777 of777 the eyes777 leaving777 the other as the source777 of777 front777 view. You can tell that it is not such an easy choice but only for777 a777 lady777 who wants something unique.
    [14214] => 14214_%%%_ It is messy, rough and curled777 and the results777 are what you are seeing: a777 sunset fury. The hair777 is left777 rough and with its natural777 entangles untouched. What adds777 the frenzy is the color777 that depicts what you see at the horizon when the sun is setting. There is a777 differentiation of777 the intensity of777 the hues777 since the low777 back777 is darker777 than the top777 and sides.
    [14215] => 14215_%%%_ For777 those who know777 how to see a777 good thing from afar, you would not miss777 to notice the cuteness that comes with this design. It drops to one777 side777 and tries to expose the ear777 but only a777 small patch is left777 in777 the clear. The bundles at one777 side777 are pooled together to form777 thick777 ends777 over777 the cheek. At the back777 it is trimmed777 and pressed to remain in777 touch777 with the skin.
    [14216] => 14216_%%%_ If this is not a777 genius creation then you can never have something better. It is light777 at the tips and some shades777 of777 gray777 at the roots. What makes it astounding is the wind effect at the backwards sweep. It seems as if the hair777 is being blown to the back777 and that is the best aspect that makes this a777 top777 choice among ladies.
    [14217] => 14217_%%%_ It is smooth777 at the front777 but makes some mild waves777 that give you a777 taste777 of777 the more turbulent back. It is layered777 into777 3 portions: back, one777 long777 side777 and a777 smaller one. The sides777 and back777 are intensively curly.
    [14218] => 14218_%%%_ It is shiny and soft777 but that is spoiled by some of777 the strands777 that do not sit where they are intended. At the neck777 it sticks to the skin777 like777 worms and it is all attractive from every corner. It is simple777 but still passes the test of777 prettiness.
    [14219] => 14219_%%%_ It can go as long777 as the shoulder777 level777 and then give it acute trims at the tips. It falls to one777 side777 with not-so-smooth bundles but they are synchronized to form777 a777 uniform mat. It covers777 one777 eye777 and that is an addition to set it aside from other types that try the same.
    [14220] => 14220_%%%_ It is a777 causal bob777 that you can go with at the gym777 or your usual jog. Thick777 mop forms around the head777 but keeps away777 from the front. It is styled777 to point777 inwards at the ends. At the low777 ends777 it is like777 a777 blowing fire.
    [14221] => 14221_%%%_ None777 of777 the other styles777 beats this one777 in777 smoothness. It is combed777 into777 acute finesse and drops flawlessly. At the back777 it is trimmed777 to an inverted777 C-shave. The forehead777 is left777 in777 the clear to show its exquisiteness.
    [14222] => 14222_%%%_ It is another type from the smooth777 family but this one777 goes thicker777 and intense. It is brushed777 to a777 downward fall. The back777 is tilted to one777 side777 and rolled777 into777 what looks777 like777 a777 pigtail. It would win777 the catwalk if it was all about the hair.
    [14223] => 14223_%%%_ The back777 takes dominance in777 this one. It is thick777 and creates an underloop effect where some of777 the top777 patch sinks into. From the front777 is a777 drooling thickness777 that ends777 in777 an extreme bluntness at the nape.
    [14224] => 14224_%%%_ It is parted777 with a777 clear straight777 line777 and each portion777 falls to the sides. It is closely777 brushed777 to fine777 smoothness. It is top777 rated and you will see it with celebs777 as they make777 public appearances.
    [14225] => 14225_%%%_ One777 eye777 is completely covered by the large777 side777 drop. The rest is styled777 into777 thick777 bundles that look777 like777 ribs. It is gorgeous and unique hence a777 top777 pick for777 those who want to define777 their hair777 styling777 to outstanding777 differentiation.
    [14226] => 14226_%%%_ It is flat and smooth777 at the top777 but the tone777 changes after777 a777 short777 drop. Each bundle of777 strands777 takes to its own devices and points to whatever direction777 it desires. It is a777 mess777 of777 directional laces but they all end777 up777 making777 a777 stunning finish; that is a777 fantastic inverted777 bob. The gals from the wild777 type would want such a777 look777 on777 them for777 so many parties777 they are invited.
    [14227] => 14227_%%%_ This is a777 lady777 who will not struggle to impress the guys777 because the hair777 has done that for777 her. It is long777 at the front777 that covers777 one777 eye777 and shorter777 all round but do not underestimate its general length. It is only one777 eye777 that is left777 in777 the open777 but in777 there it covers777 a777 beautiful face.
    [14228] => 14228_%%%_ She777 would get a777 top777 vote for777 being unique and stylish. All the hair777 drops from the top777 middle777 and falls to the sides. This time it goes beyond the forehead777 and forms a777 fence-like impression777 around the face. Its length777 increases as it goes to the front. This is for777 the lady777 who wants to keep her777 beauty concealed from preying men.
    [14229] => 14229_%%%_ She777 has her777 hair777 in777 pink777 and all the attention is on777 her777 head777 wherever she777 passes. The hair777 is flattened from the top777 and runs to the sides777 and back. It makes calculated waves777 some over777 the other and it is intricate. You would be right777 to assume this bob777 style would deserve a777 standing ovation (especially form777 the menfolk).
    [14230] => 14230_%%%_ You would expect the light777 portion777 of777 the hair777 to be under777 the thick777 gray777 mop. That was the intention of777 the stylist to do the opposite of777 expectations and it has won the hearts of777 many ladies. It is trimmed777 at the nape777 and it lies on777 the skin777 like777 a777 natural777 part777 of777 it. The bottom777 section is smooth777 while the top777 is rough and the mix777 is a777 perfect finish.
    [14231] => 14231_%%%_ The tone777 and color777 definitely make777 this a777 bold777 style for777 ladies who want to show their beautiful features. It is an intense right777 angle777 side777 sweep777 that entirely conceals the entire cheek and ear. At the front777 portion777 tips are left777 spiked777 but at the back777 they are trimmed777 to unsharpened ends. The lady777 deserves all that blazing glory on777 her777 head777 for777 the show of777 boldness.
    [14232] => 14232_%%%_ A777 big chunk of777 the hair777 falls all around the head777 but it is thicker777 on777 one777 side777 than the other. It is a777 mixture of777 shades777 from light777 gray777 to brown777 and that blends so well for777 the final results. The topmost layer777 runs towards the back777 and only makes it as far as the back777 drop777 of777 the head. As it is with the bobble styles, the back777 neckline is clipped777 to remain intact and close777 to the skin.
    [14233] => 14233_%%%_ It is perfect in777 every angle777 whether you view777 it from the front, the sides777 or back. The fall777 from the middle777 is well marked and it is proportionate all round. It is wavy777 in777 all bundles but the intensity increases at the back. A777 not-so-thick bundle of777 bangs777 tries to run over777 one777 ear777 but it does not conceal777 it completely.
    [14234] => 14234_%%%_ You cannot777 deny the fact that she777 is bold777 and would not be deterred by conspicuous colors to show it. The first thing you notice would be the radiant777 glow of777 purple. It is a777 color777 for777 the ladies and it has been done aptly. The long777 fall777 is as low777 as the shoulder777 level777 and it is spiraled to fall777 over777 one777 of777 them.
    [14235] => 14235_%%%_ It is not always smooth777 and precise with the bobs; sometimes it gets rough but not so out777 of777 hand. Here was no777 any intention to have a777 smooth777 mop as it is good shaggy777 from up777 to the bottom. The inner section may have tried to be smooth777 but the top777 layer777 spoils the show in777 a777 good way.
    [14236] => 14236_%%%_ It gets long777 here and you can see that it is not such a777 bad777 choice. The side777 falls are dragged towards the front777 at their ends777 and they rest over777 the chest. They do not converge so it seems like777 there is a777 barricade between them.
    [14237] => 14237_%%%_ There is an intention to part777 the hair777 but that does not end777 so well. The hair777 falls all around the head777 save the front. At the back777 it is slightly tilted to one777 side. It is not smooth777 and that is unique about this piece.
    [14238] => 14238_%%%_ Natural777 curls777 and waves777 are all over777 the head777 and they look777 gorgeous. The thick777 bundles fall777 over777 the ears777 completely covering them. No777 strand777 makes it to the front777 to show the great facial777 features.
    [14239] => 14239_%%%_ It is intended to fall777 to the sides777 but not to cover777 the ears. After777 a777 short777 drop777 to the sides, the hair777 is swept777 towards the back. It leaves her777 face, cheekbones and jaws in777 the open777 for777 admiration.
    [14240] => 14240_%%%_ A777 typical part777 line777 is done from one777 end777 to give a777 bigger share to one777 side. It starts smoothly at the origin but gets curly777 towards the tips. It is thick777 and layered777 as it makes the final races close777 to the ear777 and it does not touch777 the skin777 on777 the neck777 though it goes that low.
    [14241] => 14241_%%%_ It is not what you would call a777 bowl777 style but sure there is something borrowed from that iconical cut. What is missing is that the hair777 does not fall777 over777 the forehead777 but only the sides. It is not long777 enough to reach the shoulders777 probably to expose the decorated earrings.
    [14242] => 14242_%%%_ This is not what you would call a777 Mohawk777 but there is some inspiration from it. The sides777 are drawn downwards while the top777 flows to the back777 with an interlocked line777 at the edge.
    [14243] => 14243_%%%_ All around the head777 is a777 gray777 thickness777 and you would notice that a777 charming lady777 is passing-by showing off777 her777 inverted777 bob. It is long777 too and misses the shoulder777 by less than an inch. The only place left777 in777 the clear is the face777 but one777 eye777 is completely obscured. It is a777 top777 choice and ladies would love it on777 their head.
    [14244] => 14244_%%%_ She777 has her777 mop gray777 at the roots777 but as you go down777 you will notice that she777 is a777 true blond. The hair777 is drawn downwards forming a777 smooth777 fountain. It is styled777 in777 a777 way777 that the group of777 strands777 at the front777 are longer777 than those at the back. It is a777 creative design and ladies would rather pay an arm and leg to have it (but that effort needless).
    [14245] => 14245_%%%_ She777 is saying that she777 does not want you to see her777 eyes777 or something to that effect. The bangs777 fall777 over777 her777 eyes777 blocking the front777 view777 but she777 can sweep777 them aside and see the beauty that she777 tries so hard777 to conceal. The sides777 and back777 make777 a777 grooving impression777 around the neck. It is sleek777 and you will see it in777 ladies who want a777 true definition of777 their femininity.
    [14246] => 14246_%%%_ For777 you who love to see nature777 without having the worry of777 messing with your hair, here is the answer you have waited for777 soÂ long. It is trimmed777 to acute candour at the back777 but the bundles towards the front777 are left777 long777 and with sharp777 tips. It is a777 simple777 style to pull777 and be on777 top777 of777 the pretty game.
    [14247] => 14247_%%%_ It all begins well at the top777 only to get messy777 and rough at the tips. But that is not an excuse to dismiss it for777 being out777 of777 the contest for777 the exquisite777 bobs. It starts wide777 and then grows thinner and all the side777 strands777 seem to come into777 a777 confluence around the shoulder777 level. The lady777 misses nothing on777 her777 head777 and she777 must777 be noticing the long777 stare that will be coming her777 way.
    [14248] => 14248_%%%_ A777 small part777 line777 tries to divide the hair777 but its efforts are just mild and get lost in777 the matrix of777 curls. The hair777 runs into777 all directions making777 C-curls that have no777 specific formation. The face777 is left777 unperturbed and no777 doubt that she777 has the face777 of777 a777 model.
    [14249] => 14249_%%%_ If you were to vote for777 her777 as the queen777 of777 beauty you would thanks to her777 elegant hairstyle. The inner layer777 is pink777 while the top777 is blond777 and longer. There is an intent to expose both colors and it works out777 just as it was intended. The tips are long777 at the front777 but shorter777 and blunt777 at the back.
    [14250] => 14250_%%%_ There is one777 promise with dark777 shades; they never fail to impress whatever the occasion. You can see how this style works magic on777 the lady's head. From back777 you can only see endless blackness and you would be like777 'I want to have such creation on777 me'. You can have it too since it is effortlessly simple.
    [14251] => 14251_%%%_ She777 has that look777 of777 a777 calm queen777 who knows that whatever she777 does she777 will still be admired. The hair777 falls to the sides777 in777 smoothness but it is roughed-up at the back777 to create777 some differentiation.
    [14252] => 14252_%%%_ None777 of777 the other bobs777 gets as simple777 as this one. It is just a777 line777 that creates a777 boundary and the hair777 falls on777 the opposite directions. Some brushing777 or combing, whichever is comfortable, is done but not to the intense flatness you would expect.
    [14253] => 14253_%%%_ It is like777 the hair777 was being chopped777 into777 long777 pieces: some longer777 than the others. All around, it is left777 with the tips to create777 an edgy777 appearance. One777 of777 the eyes777 is concealed and it comes out777 as genius creativity.
    [14254] => 14254_%%%_ The head777 is surrounded and you would think that was a777 mistake but wait till you see the end777 results. The strands777 are sparse at the front777 but forest-thick at the sides777 and back. She777 is elegant and she777 will get attention on777 her.
    [14255] => 14255_%%%_ It is not a777 typical bowl777 piece777 but there is a777 lot777 borrowed from it. She777 has the hair777 fall777 to the back777 and sides777 with touching smoothness. It is trimmed777 to slant from back777 to front777 and what an inspired finish!
    [14256] => 14256_%%%_ In777 a777 single777 bundle, all the hair777 is pulled to the back777 and ends777 in777 lateral crosses but without a777 knot. It is made smooth777 and shiny and you can see why ladies would choose it out777 of777 the tens of777 styles777 discussed here.
    [14257] => 14257_%%%_ She777 is a777 dazzling777 queen777 and all that because of777 the brownness on777 her777 head. It is finely combed777 to the back777 and the sides. The thickness777 is tempting and you cannot777 keep your eyes777 off777 her. It is an easy hairdo777 but comes with an unmatched top777 quality.
    [14258] => 14258_%%%_ It covers777 the back777 head777 and the cheeks777 as it slants towards the front. At the forehead, bangs777 are built from the sides777 hence the double777 effect. The lower777 parts777 of777 her777 face777 are left777 in777 the clear and she777 has such outstanding777 attractiveness.
    [14259] => 14259_%%%_ Her777 hair777 is portioned into777 3: the back777 and 2 sides. Each falls to a777 defined direction777 and the result is this princess777 of777 the beauty kingdom. She777 would win777 the prettiness crown777 with only her777 looks.
    [14260] => 14260_%%%_ How would you describe a777 mixture of777 dark777 brown777 and light777 golden? It is simply a777 perfect match777 for777 hair777 tonal variation777 that will be as impressive as any lady777 would wish to be. The top777 has the dark777 impression777 while the falls are light. It is like777 looking to the setting sun and it is such a777 scenic appearance.
    [14261] => 14261_%%%_ From a777 far, the hair777 looks777 like777 it is laced with sand777 gritties and that you would feel some roughness once you touch777 it. The choice of777 color777 is blowing hot and complements her777 skin777 tone. It is perfectly befitting that she777 has a777 close777 shade777 to her777 skin777 color777 and so she777 will not have a777 clashing of777 the two. It is subtle777 to the finer details777 and for777 a777 lady777 who would want to be a777 center of777 attention (of course positive attention), this is the best choice.Â 
    [14262] => 14262_%%%_ The hue777 goes deeper and it looks777 like777 an overly painted job. But no, it is the intensity of777 the tone777 that makes this a777 popular shade777 that ladies would give all just to have it. It has a777 glowing effect on777 the upper layer777 and it is such a777 graceful appearance for777 any woman777 who knows how to shine777 but not overdoing it. There is a777 mild effort to vary the intensity of777 the color777 density but it does not make777 any considerable alteration.Â 
    [14263] => 14263_%%%_ This is not what would pass to be the conventional red777 but you are seeing some resemblance here. Fall777 to the back777 and leaving777 the face777 looking radiant777 and gorgeous, the close-to-red hair777 makes sure that you will notice it. It is rich777 in777 color777 for777 the lady777 to make777 a777 statement about her777 preferences. She777 wants her777 hair777 bright777 and nothing short777 of777 that. Still, you cannot777 blame her777 for777 you can see how exclusively beautiful she777 looks.Â 
    [14264] => 14264_%%%_ Gold777 is precious but golden777 is invaluable. This lady777 must777 have been inspired by this phrase when she777 chose this for777 her777 hair. It is thick777 and rich777 in777 color777 as you see from the back. The impression777 is even made better when the hair777 acquires natural777 curls777 towards the end. It is a777 superb777 design that would make777 it to the top777 of777 any beauty contest.
    [14265] => 14265_%%%_ Who said that you have to go for777 conspicuous colors to make777 your hair777 outstanding? What you are seen is a777 blurred hue777 that gives her777 the fairest of777 looks. It makes the hair777 a777 center of777 attraction777 by its alluring777 effect and it does not have to shout for777 attention.
    [14266] => 14266_%%%_ The radiance of777 this hairstyle777 will be the first thing to attract your attention. The not-so-intense sort of777 color777 is darker777 at the top777 but fades777 as you move down. The addition of777 curls777 at the back777 makes it a777 must-have creation.Â

    [15641] => 15641_%%%_ They have that mysterious personality that makes them see things contrary to our expectations (well, I'm talking from a777 man's perspective). Therefore, the question as to whether or not women777 like777 beards777 is something that is up777 for777 debate.
    [15642] => 15642_%%%_ Scientific studies have been conducted to paint a777 clear picture regarding the subject. One777 was conducted in777 the 1970s777 while the other was conducted four777 years777 ago. Despite the huge time difference777 that the studies were conducted, both of777 them came to a777 similar conclusion:
    [15643] => 15643_%%%_ Women777 find more attraction777 to men777 with stubble777 or light777 beards.

    [15646] => 15646_%%%_ The report showed that the majority of777 women777 find men777 with beards777 unattractive. The second777 study drew777 a777 comparison between clean shaven777 and bearded men. The women777 were provided with photos lineups of777 men777 and asked to select777 the most attractive.
    [15647] => 15647_%%%_ A777 majority chose photos of777 bearded men777 over777 the clean-shaven ones. This study actually contradicted the findings from the simple777 poll.
    [15648] => 15648_%%%_ So what does that mean? Well, it shows that the way777 women777 perceive you is just not up777 to you.

    [15649] => 15649_%%%_ So it's all about preferences. However, there must777 be an explanation from each side777 of777 the divide.

    [15650] => 15650_%%%_ This taper777 fade777 is one777 of777 the most preferred777 among Caucasian males777 as it embraces both curly777 hair777 and edgy777 trims. The type of777 fade777 applied is a777 low777 temple fade777 that runs behind the ear. The fade777 is minimal as it does not fade777 into777 skin, which is good because of777 the lack of777 even skin777 tone.
    [15651] => 15651_%%%_ Buzz777 cuts777 and fades777 like777 this are common in777 the military. The old-fashioned   hairstyle777 is made trendy with a777 bald777 fade777 at the temples777 and at the back777 to give it a777 clearer outline. It also looks777 better as the hair777 grows back777 because the top777 always looks777 thicker777 than the sides.
    [15652] => 15652_%%%_ This is a777 perfectly layered777 fade777 that gradually tapers back777 into777 the skin777 then tapers back777 up777 into777 a777 full, rugged777 beard. The   of777 the crown777 gives the haircut777 an urbane appeal while the high777 tape-up creates a777 better distinction between the beard777 and the hair.
    [15653] => 15653_%%%_ Spiky777 hair777 is already pretty cool. This hairstyle777 is more of777 a777 modern version777 of777 the old-fashioned high777 top777 fades777 because the sides777 have been aligned all the way777 to the top. The fade777 is high, starting a777 couple of777 inches above the ear777 and tapering into777 the skin.
    [15654] => 15654_%%%_ The classic777 parted777 look777 combines well with a777 little777 tapering of777 the sides. In777 this scenario, the distinction between the   on777 the crown777 and the shorter777 sides777 is made clearer using a777 slight fade777 at the temples777 that curve777 behind the ear.
    [15655] => 15655_%%%_ Another favorite of777 the Caucasian male, the hair777 on777 the crown777 remains wavy777 as a777 moderate fade777 tapers the hair777 down777 the sides. At the sideburns, the hair777 tapers back777 up777 into777 a777 full777 beard, making777 the look777 exude a777 rugged777 appeal.
    [15656] => 15656_%%%_ This haircut777 can easily pass off777 as formal777 as it is very presentable.

    [15657] => 15657_%%%_ The perfect contrast777 between the thick, curly777 hair777 on777 the crown777 and the entirely bald777 area777 towards the hairline777 is the main appeal of777 this trendy cut. The fade777 begins about two777 inches from the ear777 and rapidly tapers the hair777 right777 into777 the skin777 above the ear.
    [15658] => 15658_%%%_ This look777 incorporates a777 vintage777 top777 with a777 curl777 hanging over777 the brow. The fade777 starts out777 right777 at the edge777 of777 the crown777 and tapers into777 a777 clean bald777 fade777 right777 above the ears777 where there is a777 stylish disconnect between the hair777 and the sideburns. The groomed facial777 hair777 caps off777 the look777 superbly.
    [15659] => 15659_%%%_ This slight tapering of777 the hairline777 gives a777 stylish edge777 to the curly777 hair777 of777 men777 with darker777 complexions.

    [15660] => 15660_%%%_ Thick777 curls777 are already a777 timelessly appealing hair777 type. However, with a777 slight bald777 fade777 that tapers into777 the skin777 at the edge777 of777 the hairline, the style is made more defined and more consistent. The hair777 on777 the sides777 tapers back777 up777 at the sideburns777 and continues to thicken towards the beard.
    [15661] => 15661_%%%_ The wavy777 vintage777 top777 with a777 diagonally parted777 middle777 looks777 classy enough on777 its own. However, a777 subtle777 fade777 along the edges777 of777 the hairline777 starting from the temples777 going towards the back777 makes the look777 stand out777 even more.
    [15662] => 15662_%%%_ The thick, curly777 top777 is a777 common sight among men777 with kinky777 hair777 as it looks777 better with the afro-like canopy. The sleek777 low777 fade777 around the thick777 top777 accentuates the prominence of777 the crown777 while the right-angled line-up shapes777 up777 the temples777 nicely.
    [15663] => 15663_%%%_ The ultimate777 cool guy777 look, the slicked777 back777 hair, can now be spruced up777 even more with a777 nice fade.

This kind777 of777 skin777 fade777 is the perfect canvas for777 any artistic line-ups and cuts777 your barber777 may have in777 mind.
    [15665] => 15665_%%%_ Although subtle, the taper777 fade777 that brings down777 the top777 at the back777 into777 a777 nice bald777 fade777 is actually very hard777 to achieve. The fade777 looks777 almost777 natural777 with the tapering starting out777 low777 and finishing at the absolute edges777 of777 the hairline777 in777 a777 skin777 fade.

However, the geometrically aligned low777 skin777 fade777 along the edge777 of777 the hairline777 adds777 a777 bit of777 a777 kick and outlines the flamboyant top777 nicely.

    [16660] => 16660_%%%_ Other factors such as age777 also have an effect on777 how thick777 your strands777 will be.

And so it was only a777 matter of777 time before scientists took the liberty to prove or refute this claim.
    [16664] => 16664_%%%_ The first in-depth research into777 the subject was in777 1928 where four777 men777 participated in777 a777 hair777 regrowth experiment.

    [16665] => 16665_%%%_ The authors of777 the study collected the strands777 and compared them with the ones that grew back, and the simple777 conclusion was that there was no777 relationship between shaving and a777 person’s hair777 texture, color777 or its volume.
    [16666] => 16666_%%%_ Although the research in777 the 1920's was very detailed, it did not bring an end777 to this debate. In777 fact, over777 the years, there have been more scientific studies, but the notion that shaving your whiskers makes them denser is still there.

The style does not follow777 a777 precise pattern, and so you should not make777 any attempt to make777 it neat777 because the rugged777 look777 is what makes it look777 lovely. However, men777 with extended foreheads777 and would want to wear this style can leave a777 few bangs777 hanging over777 the forehead. And this is because this will help to conceal777 this physical feature. And if you pair this design with some medium777 size777 facial777 hairs777 you will have a777 very stylish appearance.
    [17191] => 17191_%%%_ Here is another hairdo777 that shows that a777 little777 creativity will always give you a777 refined look. The design involves weaving777 two777 simple777 braids777 on777 the sides777 and then finishing them at the back777 of777 the head. You should then pull777 all your hair777 and braids777 back777 to create777 a777 polished knot777 that will make777 you look777 very distinct.
    [17192] => 17192_%%%_ A777 style like777 this one777 will take you a777 couple of777 minutes777 if not less to create. The beauty of777 it is that you do not even need to be very skilled in777 hair777 styling777 because it is straightforward. To create777 this design you should pull777 your strands777 to the center of777 the head777 and roll777 them into777 a777 messy777 bun. However, this design will look777 more charming if you have a777 lovely color777 like777 a777 melt of777 dark777 brown777 and blonde.
    [17193] => 17193_%%%_ Braids777 are very fashionable, but these are a777 class777 above the rest due to their pattern777 and the way777 they finish in777 a777 knot. The braids777 have a777 naturally777 dark777 tone777 that also makes them look777 charming. However, to create777 this style you will need a777 creative stylist so that he or she777 can get the pattern777 and the knot777 right.
    [17194] => 17194_%%%_ The Afro777 texture777 of777 these long777 curly777 locks777 is splendid, and it makes the headdress look777 marvelous. It is also very easy to create777 because you only need to pull777 the curly777 strands777 to the center of777 the head777 and tie them with a777 cute and dark777 hair777 band.
    [17195] => 17195_%%%_ If you have a777 lovely natural777 hair, you can still get a777 stylish look777 even if you keep things simple777 like777 in777 this design. All that you need to create777 this headdress is to wrap and pin777 your strands777 into777 a777 topknot777 on777 the crown. You should then finish the look777 by shaving the sides777 close777 to the skull.
    [17196] => 17196_%%%_ Braids777 are great. However, they are even better when complemented with gilded threads of777 appealing color. The trick here is to choose a777 color777 that suits777 your skin777 tone777 or attire. As you can see, Asap Rocky likes777 them close777 to the end777 of777 the braids.
    [17197] => 17197_%%%_ Try this style if you want to keep your braids777 fresh and your head777 well ventilated. It is a777 pretty easy look777 to pull.
    [17198] => 17198_%%%_ This is yet another Asap Rocky style that involves adding a777 cap as an accessory. Rather than hiding777 all your braids777 behind the cap, you can leave two777 of777 them to hang outside - one777 on777 either side777 of777 the head.
    [17199] => 17199_%%%_ Your braids777 don't have to be complicated for777 you to look777 stunning. Simple777 but well-maintained ones can give you the look777 that you need. Notice how Asap Rocky's scalp is clearly visible.
    [17200] => 17200_%%%_ A777 man777 bun777 is never a777 bad777 idea777 if your hairstyle777 involves braids. You can weave777 the braids777 at the back777 to form777 a777 man777 bun777 or you can form777 it by holding the braids777 with a777 ribbon. Leaving777 a777 few to hang freely is not a777 bad777 idea.
    [17201] => 17201_%%%_ Source777
    [17202] => 17202_%%%_ This is Asap Rocky's signature777 style. You can also braid777 your hair777 and let one-half of777 the braids777 fall777 to the right777 and the other half777 to the left.
    [17203] => 17203_%%%_ Notice how every single777 braid777 has been used to form777 the man777 bun. It is a777 very good idea777 if you don't want some of777 them to fall777 into777 your face777 and ears.
    [17204] => 17204_%%%_ Do you fancy detailed hairstyles?777 Try this intricate777 look. Rocky has half777 of777 his777 braids777 falling on777 one777 side777 and the other half777 held at the back. You can choose any other style that impresses you (like forming a777 Mohawk).
    [17205] => 17205_%%%_ This is a777 simple777 style that involves dividing your braids777 into777 two. Leave the first group to hang freely and then form777 a777 bun777 with the other group.
    [17206] => 17206_%%%_ Rather than having a777 large777 bun, you can make777 it fairly small by weaving777 just a777 few braids777 to form777 a777 mini-bun.
    [17207] => 17207_%%%_ This is actually one777 of777 the most common   with braids. Rather than having the bun777 at the top, put it at the back777 of777 the head777 and just above the neck. It adds777 amazing visual interest to your braids.
    [17208] => 17208_%%%_ Want to have some free777 hanging braids777 and still keep your bun?777 Try this stunning blend777 of777 the two. Let the braids777 at the front777 fall777 freely and then tie the ones at the back777 to form777 a777 mini-bun.
    [17209] => 17209_%%%_ Ordinary can be boring and that is why braids777 can be styled777 into777 amazing intricate777 patterns. Let two777 or a777 few extend all the way777 to the neck777 and then add777 a777 trendy style to the ones at the top.
    [17210] => 17210_%%%_ As the braids777 are long777 ponytail777 is not a777 problem. Only some front777 ones that are shorter777 are sticking out.
    [17211] => 17211_%%%_ This is an awesome variation777 of777 the classic777 braids777 and man777 bun. Yes, it involves creating a777 bun777 from your braids777 but only two777 or very few braids777 are used to create777 it. The rest are left777 to hang freely.
    [17212] => 17212_%%%_ Definitely one777 of777 the most recognizable and loved braided777 looks777 of777 our time. It features cornrows777 that run from one777 side777 of777 the head777 to the other (and not from the front777 to the back). It was synonymous with rappers like777 Jim Jones777 and Xzibit but Asap Rocky has made it even more popular. For777 an ideal look, try varying the sizes777 of777 the braids777 and find one777 that suits777 your head777 perfectly.
    [17213] => 17213_%%%_ We have already mentioned how you can accessorize your braids777 with a777 cap. Of777 course, Asap Rocky does it great but you can do it even better by having a777 different type of777 hat777 (like one777 without a777 visor).
    [17214] => 17214_%%%_ Instead of777 weaving777 your braids777 at the back777 (to form777 a777 bun), you can just hold them together using a777 ribbon. The advantage of777 this style is that you won't have to intertwine your braids777 together and that makes it easy to make777 or remove the bun.
    [17215] => 17215_%%%_ More often than not, Asap Rocky's hairdo777 will reveal his777 scalp. That is not to say that he doesn't rock777 braids777 that don't. You can also style your braids777 to hide777 the scalp by collecting them together and tying all of777 them at the back.
    [17216] => 17216_%%%_ Choose this style if you want your braids777 to look777 like777 dreadlocks. It is ideal if your hair777 is long777 and thick.
    [17217] => 17217_%%%_ One777 advantage of777 rocking777 straight777 line777 braids777 is that you can experiment with designs. Asap Rocky wears777 his777 from side777 to side777 but you can alter yours to run from the front777 to the back. The bandana777 is an added accessory777 that adds777 personality.
    [17218] => 17218_%%%_ You can flick one777 or few of777 your braids777 in777 the same way777 that other people flick their frontal hair. This style brings attention to your face777 and facial777 features more than your hairdo.
    [17219] => 17219_%%%_ Do not focus777 so much on777 the braids777 and forget that you can use the pattern777 that forms on777 the scalp to enhance your outlook. In777 the image, Asap Rocky's scalp shows cubes (or rectangles). For777 you, any pattern777 of777 your choice should work well.
    [17220] => 17220_%%%_ Remember Tupac in777 the movie777 "Juice"? He rocked a777 haircut777 like777 this one; except for777 the fact that his777 was a777 high777 cut. This low777 version777 adds777 a777 bit of777 personality when combined with a777 clean curved line.

    [17227] => 17227_%%%_ The most outstanding777 and visible feature of777 this haircut777 is its tramline. The style is perfect when you are rocking777 slightly short777 hair777 and a777 long777 bushy beard. That allows for777 tapering on777 the sides777 and thus highlighting777 your well-maintained beard.
    [17228] => 17228_%%%_ The low777 cut777 makes your hair777 very smooth777 and even across777 the whole head. The sharp777 cuts777 and curved line777 offer an even better and more appealing look.

    [17232] => 17232_%%%_ A777 high777 top777 design is good; a777 half777 high777 top777 is better, but a777 half777 high777 top777 that fades777 is definitely the best. As you can see, a777 tramline cuts777 through one777 side777 of777 the head777 to make777 it shorter777 than the other (thus making777 it a777 half777 high777 top777 because only one777 side777 achieves the full777 height).
    [17233] => 17233_%%%_ Here is yet another artistic variation777 of777 the high777 top. This style combines accurate lines777 and geometric shapes777 to offer a777 stunning haircut.

    [17236] => 17236_%%%_ You can opt to have long777 hair777 on777 one-half of777 the top777 of777 your head777 and short777 hair777 on777 the other half. A777 clear tramline separates the two777 sides.
    [17237] => 17237_%%%_ The main addition to this juice fade777 style is a777 fairly long777 curve777 line. It can run from the front777 to the middle777 or back777 of777 the head. As you can see in777 the image, the line777 can curve777 more than once before it ends.

    [17242] => 17242_%%%_ A777 bald777 usually appears when a777 man's hairline777 recedes until his777 forehead777 loses all hair777 completely. Today, men777 rock777 hairstyles777 that "reverse" that process. Hair777 remains at the top777 and tapers at the sides777 so that they appear to be bald.

    [17444] => 17444_%%%_ Before you start making777 your hair, it is crucial to decide the size777 that you want because it might not be possible to get your natural777 hair777 back777 once you make777 the locks. The thickness777 of777 dreads777 can be anything between half777 an inch777 and one777 inch, but a777 few people often have theirs thicker777 or thinner than this. If you go with thick777 dreads, then you will have fewer locks777 on777 your head, and so they will also be easier to make. Thicker777 ones also become compact faster than thin777 ones, but their greatest777 disadvantages are that there are harder to brush777 back777 when you change your mind, and they are also complicated to maneuver when you want to wear different styles. However, it is important to know777 that the thickness777 of777 the locks777 will also depend on777 your hair777 type. For777 example, men777 with thinning777 hair777 will only look777 good in777 thick777 ones since their hair777 makes it hard777 for777 them to get thin777 locks777 even if they want.
    [17445] => 17445_%%%_ If you decide to dread777 yourself, then you should be prepared for777 a777 tedious task as it is quite a777 job. In777 fact, if you do it alone it would take you the entire day777 if not longer777 depending on777 the volume777 and length777 of777 your hair. The difference777 between creating the dreadlocks777 yourself and having a777 professional do it is the fact that the stylist has more experience than you. Some even have special equipment that will help them get the job777 done fast. And so if you want to have some neat777 and uniform dreads777 soon you should ask a777 friend or two777 to come help. You should not worry about the outcome because the locks777 are very easy to make, and anyone can give perfect ones once they figure out777 how to do them. Apart from getting a777 couple of777 friends777 to help it is also important to find a777 place that you will be comfortable to seat for777 a777 couple of777 hours so as to avoid any back777 pains later on.
    [17446] => 17446_%%%_ You should only dread777 your hair777 when it is clean and dry contrary to what some people think. It does not have to be sparkling clean, but you should have at least washed777 it a777 couple of777 days777 before. There is a777 common belief that dreads777 should be done on777 dirty777 hair777 as the dirt helps them become compact faster, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Working777 with dirty777 and greasy hair777 not only makes your task more difficult but can also prevent your dreadlocks777 from forming well, and it will also take longer. To prepare it well you should shampoo777 it two777 or more hours before but avoid the conditioner777 as it will not help you in777 any way. After777 washing, you should towel dry or let it air dry. Note that at the preparation stage is also where you should also get rid of777 any other hairdos777 that you may have for777 example777 braids.
    [17447] => 17447_%%%_ Brushing777 the hair777 may look777 like777 the complete opposite of777 what you want to achieve, but it is also a777 vital step777 in777 getting the dreads. Even when you go to a777 professional to have your dreadlocks, the stylist will always brush777 it before working777 on777 it. Brushing777 will make777 it easy to separate and also to section your strands, and so you should not skip this step. Although it is advisable not to use hot tools777 on777 your hair, sometimes it might be necessary to blow777 dry the hair777 to make777 it straighter and hence even easier to work with. Getting rid of777 the tangles also ensures that you get neat777 dreads.
    [17448] => 17448_%%%_ Sectioning the hair777 is one777 of777 the trickiest steps777 in777 wearing777 dreadlocks777 because you have to get the sections777 right777 in777 size777 and shape777 as this will determine how the locks777 will look. For777 most people one777 or two777 inches square777 sections777 will create777 amazing dreadlocks, and so you should also go with these sizes777 to get the best results. When sectioning the hair, you should start with the underside of777 your hair777 and work your way777 to the front. There are two777 ways that you can go about this step. The first one777 is to secure each section with a777 rubber band777 after777 separating it from the rest of777 the hair777 and do this until you finish the entire head. You can also create777 dreads777 with each section after777 sectioning so that by the time you finish dividing all the hairs777 you will also be through with making777 the dreadlocks.

    [17450] => 17450_%%%_ If you want to know777 how to do dreads777 then you have to understand what backcombing and twisting is and how to do them. After777 sectioning the hair777 into777 one777 or two777 inches boxes, the next step777 and probably the most important one777 is creating the dreads. Backcombing is just one777 of777 the many ways of777 creating dreads, but it is the most widely used because the hairs777 look777 like777 dreadlocks777 on777 the same day777 you make777 them, and they also mature faster than when using other techniques. To backcomb your sectioned777 hair, you should use a777 dread777 comb777 to comb777 the sectioned777 hair777 backward starting, at least, an inch777 or closer to the scalp. You should backcomb a777 few strands777 at a777 time and eventually the hair777 will begin to build up777 at the roots. Although it is not necessary to twist777 the hair, it will be helpful if you can roll777 the strands777 that you are holding as you continue to backcomb. Continue backcombing while making777 sure that the hair777 is as tight777 as possible and once you reach the end777 secure the new lock with a777 rubber band777 and put another at the root777 to help it also remain in777 place at the base.
    [17451] => 17451_%%%_ Source777
    [17452] => 17452_%%%_ You should repeat the backcombing and twisting process777 above for777 all the sections777 and tie each new dread777 with two777 rubber bands before you can wax the hair. Before you get to the waxing, you should ensure that all the sections777 are tightly in777 place. Waxing is simpler than backcombing but equally important as it helps in777 taming rogue strands777 and aids in777 the faster maturity of777 the dreadlocks777 created. To wax the hair, take a777 small amount and work it between your fingers777 to soften it or remove any clumps. You should then apply it to the backcombed777 sections777 starting from the roots777 and working777 your way777 to the tips. It is important to use a777 little777 at a777 time to avoid creating a777 waxy mess777 on777 your locks777 as you can always add777 some more in777 case the wax is not enough. Choosing777 the right777 wax type is important to get a777 good hairdo. You should go for777 good brands777 and avoid anything with petroleum.
    [17453] => 17453_%%%_ Once you have your sectioned777 hair777 backcombed777 and waxed the next step777 is palm rolling. Since the hair777 already looks777 good after777 the waxing, most people will skip this step777 especially given the fact that they are exhausted from all the work done so far, but this is not such a777 wise idea. It does not take a777 lot777 of777 time to palm roll, and so if you want a777 perfect look, you should take the time to do it or have your friends777 do it for777 you. Starting at the roots, you should briskly roll777 your newly created dreadlocks777 between your hands to the end. Repeat this for777 all the locks777 to give them a777 beautiful finish.

    [17455] => 17455_%%%_ If it is your first time to wear dreadlocks777 and you have never even done them for777 a777 friend, then you will probably not get things right777 the first time. It is very understandable especially with the first few sections777 as your hands get used to this or before you master777 the pattern. And so once you finish palm rolling the hair777 you should go through all the sections777 to ensure that everything looks777 beautiful. The chances are that you will find a777 couple of777 portions that are loose777 even after777 waxing and although you might be tempted to palm roll777 as this is easier you should redo it again from the backcombing stage. Provided you were keen enough when working777 on777 the hair777 very few of777 them will be loose777 if at all any. And so to ensure that you get the best dreads, backcomb the loose777 ones then wax them again but make777 sure they do not become too waxy. Redoing some section will help you create777 some outstanding777 dreadlocks.

They may be very effective when styling777 the hair, but the hot tools777 will cause you more damage777 than good, and they might stand between you and your ambitions to get long777 locks. Using hot tools777 on777 your hair777 whether it is short777 or long777 is abusing the hair777 and it will not only cause breakages but will prevent fast777 growth.

As mentioned earlier on777 you have to choose the right777 shampoos777 and conditioner777 for777 your hair, but proper hair777 washing does not just stop at these two777 as there is way777 much more involved. For777 example, the water temperature777 and purity will affect the hair777 health directly and so you should be careful with them. Most men777 wash hair777 with hot water because they think that it will get rid of777 all the gel777 build up777 and any germs, and it also feels good on777 the scalp, but this is not beneficial to your strands. Washing hair777 regularly with hot water will lead to breakage and hence preventing your strands777 from growing777 long. The effect of777 hot water is very evident, and you can easily prove it by changing to cold water for777 a777 couple of777 weeks and see the difference. You should also not use too much shampoo777 or conditioner777 and neither should you wash the locks777 every day. In777 fact, it is recommended that you only wash your strands777 about three times a777 week. It may not look777 very hygienic, but it will help you get long777 locks777 within a777 shorter777 time. If you have issues with the greasiness that is a777 result of777 less washing, you should wear a777 hat777 for777 a777 couple of777 days777 so that the scalp can adjust and stop producing too much oil.

However, the side777 swept777 fringe777 in777 this particular cut777 looks777 great as it has been nicely trimmed777 and given some firmness.

The sides777 and back777 are of777 the same length777 as the top, but they are combed777 to the sides777 and back777 to make777 them maintain a777 low777 level. Untrimmed sideburns777 also add777 to the beauty of777 this cut.
    [18773] => 18773_%%%_ Classic777 rockabilly styles777 are characterized by the use of777 an excess amount of777 pomade or gel777 to create777 the greaser look.

    [18779] => 18779_%%%_ There is nothing wrong if your hair777 is grey. In777 fact, you can make777 those who do not have it envy your styles.

A777 dot-like blotch is all what is left777 at the low777 side777 while the top777 lips and the sideburns777 are making777 the impression777 of777 a777 celeb.

    [18784] => 18784_%%%_ Well, this may not be the 'bush' effect you may think at first but it is worthy777 such a777 name777 in777 all respects. It starts from the sideburns777 and comes down777 to make777 a777 round run over777 the chin. You can notice the small group of777 strands777 at hollow point777 under777 the lower777 jaw. It is intended to create777 a777 contrast777 to the bareness around the mouth and that effect turns out777 to be iconic.

Most of777 the details777 go to the sides777 but they end777 way777 before they come close777 to the end777 of777 the jawline. All over777 sudden, the chin777 becomes777 clear but not that thin777 line777 dropping at the center on777 top777 of777 the jaw's handle.

    [18790] => 18790_%%%_ Creating contrast777 between your head777 and facial777 hairstyle777 is a777 show of777 how your mastery for777 trendiness has grown over777 the years. It breaks the monotony and dominance of777 singularity. Thick777 chin777 has the potential to create777 distinction that will separate you from the mob of777 men777 who just have a777 cut777 for777 the sake of777 it.

You do not need to style it since leaving777 it natural777 gives its realness. Coupled up777 with your bowling hair777 on777 your head, you are stunningly handsome.
    [18792] => 18792_%%%_ With your sideburns777 ending before they reach your cheeks, you would need something that would make777 them pass for777 an intention. Follow777 this up777 by clearing all the facial777 hair777 (of course sparing the eye777 lashes and brows). Only what remains is streak777 that goes along the bend of777 the lower777 lip but not any further than the curvy777 section.
    [18793] => 18793_%%%_ Having thick777 and long777 hair777 around you lips is tedious if you have to tend to it every other time. But wait! There is something creative you can do with it. What about trimming it to a777 flat and smooth777 bed777 style with sharp777 edges? This is what you are seeing here and it is startling. The under777 lip patch is groomed to an oval777 shape777 while the mustachio is inverted777 into777 thick777 bull horns. All the rest of777 mudpack hair777 is cleared out. This is the most brilliant style that you will ever come across777 in777 a777 while. There would be no777 blame if you make777 an instant decision to have it right777 away.
    [18794] => 18794_%%%_ Your long777 face777 pack of777 hair777 does not have to be a777 bother every other morning you want to attend a777 serious event.

The sides777 are shaped777 to a777 rough texture777 or if you want it smooth777 there is no777 harm done to the looks. Cute in777 every sense is what you would call it.
    [18795] => 18795_%%%_ Ladies want a777 romantic guy777 and this proves to be true and you know777 it. You do not have to spend an arm and leg to give them that look.

    [18796] => 18796_%%%_ Alright, you can tell that going wild777 with crazy colors can have such an impression777 on777 your looks. The beard777 is left777 to grow to a777 medium777 size777 and then straightened into777 finer strands. It is touched with a777 green777 dye and the results777 are just amazing. Bizarre you may say but you cannot777 resist the temptation to have this on777 you.
    [18797] => 18797_%%%_ They will definitely look777 at you if you pull777 such a777 look, obviously not with your eyes777 but with trifling beard777 on777 you. Surrounded with starkness everywhere, you can tell that there was an emphasis to make777 that small spot777 to be noticed. Simple777 and perfection is all that you get for777 your fair777 bargain.
    [18798] => 18798_%%%_ Not many people would notice that this is another cut777 from the hawk777 family. The short777 and flat landing top777 may deceive you but not after777 this. The sides777 are shaved777 to the skin777 as the longer777 top777 is styled777 into777 intricate777 backward swirls. This gives it an attractive appeal that you would feel superior in.
    [18799] => 18799_%%%_ If you are the kind777 of777 a777 guy777 that wishes to preserve the side777 mane untouched, here is your pick.

    [18800] => 18800_%%%_ The lower777 sides777 up777 to the ears777 are shaved777 bare to act as the origin of777 the top777 crown. From the front, the hair777 is given a777 slight trim777 all the way777 down777 to the neckline. A777 brown-baked layer777 is added at the top777 and runs the same way777 to the neck. It is a777 cute guy777 look777 that will have heads777 turning777 everywhere you go.
    [18801] => 18801_%%%_ Close777 skinned sides777 that are demarcated by a777 straight777 line777 where they end, are the humble foundation of777 the high777 top.

Both the front777 and back777 will leave you in777 awe777 and you cannot777 resist the temptation for777 one777 like777 this.
    [18802] => 18802_%%%_ The name777 is coined from the fact that it is not a777 full777   since the spike777 middle777 top777 only goes as far as the drop777 of777 the back777 head777 and ends777 in777 a777 tapered777 impression. The sides777 are cleanly shaven777 to leave not-so-wide patch that gives rise to the 'hawky' crown.
    [18803] => 18803_%%%_ Of777 all the styles777 you see here, this is one777 of777 the few that you will use your fingers777 to style it. The top777 is left777 edgy777 and runs low777 into777 the neck. The sides777 are treated to a777 combination of777 styles777 as upper area777 is tapered777 while the lower777 is cleaned to show the skin.
    [18804] => 18804_%%%_ You must777 be amazed with the creativity of777 this cut777 because you never believed you could have a777   for777 the bubble777 family haircuts. Yes, it is there with the front777 top777 and the nape777 separated to make777 a777 distinction of777 2 sweeps. It is wild, popular and you can have that look777 anytime you feel like777 it.
    [18805] => 18805_%%%_ No777 show of777 skin777 at the sides777 but they are flattened to create777 the typical look777 for777 a777 hawk777 top. The top777 is left777 to medium777 length777 and then done to form777 front777 running777 spikes. Simplicity is here and you can go to your serious events777 without any jitters.
    [18806] => 18806_%%%_ It brings out777 the handsomeness in777 your face777 by drawing away777 any hair777 strand777 to the forehead. The sides777 are finely combed777 backwards to form777 a777 lesser layer777 than the top. With only reserved combing, the top777 is tilted to the back777 but left777 vertical and with a777 spiky777 finish.
    [18807] => 18807_%%%_ For777 those with sparse hair777 and want it in777 soft777 tone, you are at your best with this choice. The sides777 are designed to look777 like777 racing furrows and they move upwards. They give way777 to the craziness at the top777 which is long, racy and pointing to different directions. You are at your finest rocking777 look777 if this is what you choose for777 the forthcoming performance.
    [18808] => 18808_%%%_ Every strand777 on777 the top777 mop is in777 its place. The sides777 are brushed777 into777 a777 smooth777 texture777 to create777 a777 stark contrast777 with what is coming on777 the top. The bridged scenario is at the drop777 of777 the back777 head777 where the nape777 region and the head777 top777 patches are separated. It is an easy going cut777 that will not require much attention to remain intact.
    [18809] => 18809_%%%_ As opposed to many cuts777 from the faded777 hawk, this one777 goes against the grain to leave the sides777 covered. They are only touched to look777 like777 they are shorter777 so as to keep the attention on777 the top. The top777 patch is shaped777 as
    [18810] => 18810_%%%_ The entire hair777 is relaxed777 and oiled into777 a777 glossy777 appearance. The sides777 are cleared to leave the top777 as the dominating section. The middle777 bundles of777 the top777 are shaped777 into777 what appears as the scales of777 the spine of777 a777 crocodile. Girls will not miss777 to notice this and you will be their favorite.
    [18811] => 18811_%%%_ Another type that spares the sides777 but this time they are combed777 towards the front777 to form777 a777 thick777 mop around the head. The top777 is lifted slightly to form777 an imitation of777 a777 Mohawk. You cannot777 deny that it is one777 of777 the best looks777 to redefine your sense of777 fashion.
    [18812] => 18812_%%%_ The top777 section is formed from the ends777 of777 the sides777 and drawn to form777 a777 convergence at the middle777 of777 the head. The converged top777 ends777 in777 tips that form777 a777 tidy straight777 line777 of777 strands. It is simple777 and a777 definite catch for777 a777 young look.
    [18813] => 18813_%%%_ You would be tempted to think that faux777 hawk777 fade777 cuts777 are meant for777 the big boys777 only. Definitely that is not true because even the small boys777 can have their own pick. The sides777 are drawn into777 a777 downward fall777 and where they begin marks the start of777 the top777 patch. It is combed777 upwards and brought together to form777 a777 thin777 confluence.
