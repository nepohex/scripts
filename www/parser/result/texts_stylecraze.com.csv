Make sure you adjust the bangs on your weave according to the width of your forehead - the narrower your forehead, the smaller your bangs. Secure the upper-section with a bobby pin and let the rest fall free. Use a light hairspray to keep your locks in place, and you're good to go.;http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Cornrows-Pompadour.jpg;Cornrows Pompadour;

http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/alopecia-hair-loss-treatment/;Androgenic Alopecia;Androgenic alopecia, also known as 'male pattern baldness,' can strike young as well as old people.Â Women can get this too. It's genetic, so having a family history can predict if you might inherit it. In both men and women, it's linked to having an excess of male hormones (androgens) around the hair follicles, which can block hair growth. Women are more likely to develop androgenic alopecia after menopause when they have fewer female hormones. Approximately 50% men by the age of 50 years and 15% of women before the time they reach Menopause have some degrees of androgenic alopecia present in them.;http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Onion-Extract.jpg;Onion Extract;
http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/alopecia-hair-loss-treatment/;Female Pattern Baldness Or Androgenetic Alopecia;Female pattern baldness is known as Androgenetic Alopecia, which is seen in women. It is very seldom that female patients experience complete hair loss. Usually, women lose hair in patches. The hair loss usually starts from hair thinning at the front, side or at the crown.;http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Black-Gram-Hair-Mask.jpg;Black Gram Hair Mask;

http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/alopecia-hair-loss-treatment/;Alopecia Areata;Alopecia areata causes a few temporary bald patches on the scalp. It tends to run in families and usually strikes in childhood. This hair loss problem probably is a part of an immune system disorder. In this disease, the body's natural defenses mistakenly attack its own tissue. Once the hair has fallen out in certain spots, new growth is suppressed for weeks or months. This type of alopecia sometimes affects people who have other 'autoimmune' diseases like thyroid disease, lupus, or pernicious anemia. Sometimes, it may produce complete scalp baldness (alopecia totalis) or total loss of body hair (alopecia universalis).;http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Henna.jpg;Henna;http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/home-remedies-to-cure-hair-fungus/
http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/alopecia-hair-loss-treatment/;Telogen Effluvium;Telogen effluvium is a form of hair loss often associated with pregnancy, medication use, life stress, or surgery. It results in a larger amount of hair cycling into the resting (telogen) state where the hairs are ready to fall out. This type of alopecia usually improves on its own after several months. After a few months, the hair follicles are usually back at their growing state, and the hair loss ceases.;http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Castor-Oil-1.jpg;Castor Oil;http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/home-remedies-to-control-hair-fall/
http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/alopecia-hair-loss-treatment/;Traction Alopecia;Traction alopecia usually occurs as a result of certain hairstyles such as braids, high ponytails, cornrows, chignons, buns or twists if worn regularly. The main reason for this type of alopecia is pulling of the hair follicle. Some signs of this are tension, headaches, itchiness, red scalp or random bald patches. There may even be hair breakage around the scalp.;http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lemon-Seeds-And-Pepper-Corns.jpg;Lemon Seeds And Pepper Corns;
http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/alopecia-hair-loss-treatment/;Onion Extract;There are many causes for alopecia to occur. The causes may be allergies, toxins, chemicals, burns, injuries and infections. Also, some medications like anabolic steroids can cause hair loss like those used in kidney failure, chemotherapy, and radiation. Even Vitamin A overdose may lead to hair fall, iron deficiency, anemia, thyroid, fever or pregnancy. Hair fall can also result when one indulges in too much bleaching, dyeing, tight braiding, blow drying or using hot curlers.;http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Fenugreek-Seeds.jpg;Fenugreek Seeds;

http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/alopecia-hair-loss-treatment/;Essential Oil;This treatment is also fairly effective for alopecia areata. Hair regrowth takes 8 to 12 months. The treatment has to be continued for an infinite time as stopping treatment will mean the hair loss will start again. This is hence not a permanent solution.;http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vitamin-Supplements.jpg;Vitamin Supplements;

http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/tips-to-take-care-of-your-coloured-hair/;Pre-Color Care;Selection of the shade is the most difficult part of hair coloring. Especially if you are planning to do it at home. Because the color, as it appears on the color box and the way it turns out on your hair, is very different. For example, ash is flat, red is bright, gold is brassy. Your best bet is to pick shades that are neutral or warm. The softer the name, the softer will be the result.;http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/hair-pack-chemically-treate-2.jpg;hair pack chemically treate;

Damaged hair, filled with split ends, inhibit the growth and health of hair by causing thinning, and breakage. Hence, getting your hair regularly trimmed to avoid unhealthy split ends is essential for enhanced hair length. If you've ever had split ends, you know what a nuisance they can be, especially for people with dry or damaged hair. Regularly trimming your hair ensures a reduction in the number of split ends and gives your hair every chance of growing. However, make sure you don't overdo the trimming, and either cut your hair too short or cut it too regularly.;http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/7.-Switch-Your-Pillow-Covers.jpg; Switch Your Pillow Covers;

Medicines falling under the category of antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and beta-blockers are likely to cause excessive hair loss.

http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/how-to-stop-hair-fall/;Medication And Treatments;This is a pattern that is affected by the hormonal levels in the body.

The thinning pattern, however, is different in women. They don't show a receding hair line but overall thinning over the scalp but mostly over the top and sides.;http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Hair-Care-Experts.jpg;Hair Loss Tips From Hair Care Experts;
http://www.stylecraze.com/articles/how-to-stop-hair-fall/;Hyperthyroidism;The most common cause leading to premature baldness is the hormones. It is mainly a hereditary condition that is known as male-pattern baldness or female pattern baldness. Continuous researches made on hair fall have proved that certain sex hormones, both in men and women cause a particular type of permanent hair loss. This pattern is, however, more susceptible in men. Typically, the signs of this kind of hair loss may begin from the days of puberty. While hair thinning is the initial symptom, this may end with premature baldness within the 30's.Â This may be marked under the category of hereditary disorders. If your father or grandfather had a history of baldness, you are more susceptible to premature baldness.;http://cdn2.stylecraze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/40-Things-that-actually-work-for-hairfall-001.jpg; Things that actually work for hairfall ;
