http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;Center Parted Fringe;Center parted bangs have been very trendy in the last few years, and it's an added bonus that they're one of the easiest to style.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;Long And Choppy;These long, textured bangs have enough choppy texture to bring some edge to your look and make precise styling less of a concern.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;Curly Bangs;Ditch the old idea that bangs can't work with curly hair! Although it's never a great idea to cut your own bangs without experience, this is doubly true for curly hair. A trusted professional will take your specific curl pattern into account, giving you perfect bangs that show off your eyes and keep hair out of your face.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/curly-bangs-225x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;Long And Blunt;The straight line created by these long, blunt bangs cuts dramatically across the face, creating a bold, eye-popping look.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;Asymmetrical Bangs;Make a statement with these dramatically asymmetrical and choppy bangs.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;See Through Bangs;One of the biggest beauty trends to come out of Korea, these see-through bangs are soft, romantic, and low commitment.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;Bettie Bangs;Despite becoming popular in the modern resurgence of pin-up style, especially with celebrities like Katy Perry, these short bangs that curve up at the sides are most associated with '50s icon Bettie Page. Because there are many more cases of failure than success when it comes to pulling off this fringe, we'd recommend trying a longer, softer bang before progressing to this look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bettie-bangs-266x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;Long Centre Parted Bangs;These long bangs create a curtain effect perfect for slimming and framing your face.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;Choppy Baby Bangs;Very short and very choppy, these edgy bangs are about as bold as face faming styles come.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;Bumper Bangs;Looking for temporary bangs and a vintage style? Get these bumper bangs by rolling hair in towards the face and pinning in place.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;Short Rounded Bangs;Unlike Bettie bangs that curve up at the sides, these short bangs are longer at the sides, creating a softly rounded silhouette. While this style might not work for women with rounded faces, it's a game changer for anyone with an oval or oblong face.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/short-rounded-bangs-277x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;V Shaped Bangs;Cutting a dramatic, vampirish silhouette, these V-shaped bangs are an exaggerated take on Bettie bangs. Their shape tends to make the forehead appear wider, meaning you might want to avoid them if your face is proportionally top-heavy.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/V-shaped-bangs-210x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-types-of-bangs/;Shaggy Bangs;These shaggy bangs have been cut into vertically, making them lighter than a blunt fringe, and somewhat see-through even when they're hanging in your face.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-blonde-hair-color-ideas-for-2016/;Blonde Bombshell;This gravity-defying coif is all the more lovely with the model's warm, blonde hair color. To achieve this look, your stylist will have to let the top strands of your hair process longer than the roots and lower layers, allowing a light brunette to peak through a muted gold for a more natural feel. The longer you expose this color to sunlight, the brighter your blonde will become.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1-2-225x300.jpg; ;

If you're particularly daring and have a pretty liberal work place, take a note from Cruella deVille and go for this two-toned, creative color combination.

However, a reverse ombre on blonde hair looks absolutely stunning! Toy around with different blondes to choose one that you love (we happen to adore the model's cool blonde) and then select a darker shade that juxtaposes your blonde for your ombre. Brunettes and reds work very well for this!;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/7-2-225x300.jpg; ;

This cool, almost-grey-but-not-quite color looks stunning with pale and dark skin alike.

If you don't want to wait for your blonde to grow out (or if your roots are still light), fake dark roots with a trip to the salon and some dark hair dye.

This blonde hair with lowlights color works especially well on short or layered hair, as it breaks up an otherwise concentrated mass of color. To avoid too much contrast, select blondes and brunettes that are only a few shades apart from each other and have your stylist create very subtle low-lights.

Balayage can, in fact, breathe new life into an otherwise dull and outdone blonde. If you are looking to brighten your blonde without actually changing your color, get a 'light' balayage: ie, have your stylist bleach and tone your tips through balayage for a bright, updated new blonde.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/15-3-184x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-blonde-hair-color-ideas-for-2016/;Babydoll Blonde;Soft, light blonde curls are synonymous with lots of feminine icons: baby dolls, angels, princesses, etc. If you want to create that soft, romantic feel with your own hair, go for a cool blonde layered over a light golden hue. The contrast of cool and warm will result in a breathtaking color combination that is ideal with porcelain skin. If you want to try this color yourself, we recommend a visit to your stylist.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16-3-211x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-blonde-hair-color-ideas-for-2016/;Ice Blonde Colored Hair;Cool hues pair well with the red hot, as demonstrated by this model with her icy blonde hair and bright red lips. In order to keep this look from being too chill, only have the top layer of your hair colored a cool platinum: keep the rest a slightly darker blonde for dimension. This color combination looks beautiful when braided, as it allows the different shades of blonde to blend together.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/17-3-282x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/20-blonde-hair-color-ideas-for-2016/;Snow Bunny Blonde Hair Dye;This snowy, ashy, grey-blonde is perfect for both pale and darker skinned gals. Because this color hovers between blonde and grey, it can be paired with a variety of makeup or color palettes and still look wonderful. Achieve this color by bleaching and dyeing over with an ash blonde, keeping it toned. Go for a grey glaze to further heighten the ash of your hair and embrace your roots for a more natural, dimensional color.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/19-3-200x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Undercut Faux-Hawk Style;At first glance, this haircut might look like a typical undercut style with longer hair on top, but a section of longer hair runs all the way to the nape of the neck, creating a mohawk silhouette. More manageable than a classic mohawk, the length in this style tapers significantly from front to back, meaning you only need to worry about styling from the crown upwards. Go for a slicked back look like Bryce has done here, or try something like a quiff or pompadour for a special occasion.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Undercut-Faux-Hawk-Style-300x198.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Comb Over With Defined Part;If you're looking for one of Bryce Harper's haircuts that's fashionable without being too flashy, and is appropriate for professional settings, try this stylish look.The comb over is framed by a nicely defined part and styled with enough product to impressively stay put during the game, and unlike the edgier undercut looks, this style features sides that are shorter than the top but left long enough so that skin doesn't show through.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Tapered-Comb-Over-With-Defined-Part-300x254.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Slicked Back Platinum Look;It doesn't get much lighter than this! Harper stepped far away from his natural hair color with this ultra bright platinum shade. The haircut here is a fairly simple taper cut, styled in a basic slicked style to let the color be the standout star. If you're planning on going this light, it's a good idea to have your color done by a professional, as bleaching accidents can result in some truly regrettable shades of orange.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Slicked-Back-Platinum-Look-240x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Pompadour With Undercut;This high volume haircut is an example of a modern pompadour, with hair styled backwards and upwards. Keeping the sides in a short undercut helps to reduce styling time, especially if you're trying to make your style stick all day long, or during intense physical activity.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/pompadour-with-undercut-300x169.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;High Quiff Style With Beard;By styling the longer hair on top forward and then upward right at the hairline, this modern quiff cut is a little less retro looking than a pompadour. Using a volumizing mousse on damp hair will help hair achieve maximum height before you add definition with a wax or paste product.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/high-quiff-style-with-beard-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Skin Faded Sides;With this haircut, Bryce Harper went for super closely cut sides in a skin faded style. For guys with really thick hair, this technique helps to reduce bulkiness and keeps things looking clean around the ears and nape of the neck, allowing more time between trims. Harper's hair is left longer on top as usual, and in a slicked back style that doesn't require quite as much precision as a pompadour or quiff.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Skin-Faded-Sides--300x206.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Blonde Comb Over;Bryce Harper's hair looks to have undergone some chemical lightening in this heartthrob style. We can see more notes of pale and golden blonde, but the overall look is still fairly natural, as he hasn't moved too far away from the color he was born with.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/blonde-comb-over-300x260.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Combed Over Style With High Undercut;This haircut features a higher undercut, which makes it a good choice for thick haired men who want to cut down on their styling time. Longer hair on top is combed over, and is framed by the edge of the undercut instead of creating a defined part.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/combed-over-style-with-high-undercut-300x194.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Man Bun With Undercut;If you love undercut styles with much longer hair on top, the man bun can be a practical way to style hair for working out, travelling, or any time you're short on styling time. To tame fly-aways and keep hair from looking frizzy, use a product like a smoothing or texturizing cream before you tie hair into place.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/man-bun-with-undercut--200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Slicked Back Tapered Cut;Gradually tapering in length from front to back and down the sides, this is a classic haircut that lends itself well to different types of styling, including a slicked back style as shown, or a softer parted style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/slicked-back-tapered-cut-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Slick Comb Over;With a super high undercut and longer hair that's slicked into a comb over on top, this is an edgy haircut for men who are hoping to spend a minimal amount of time styling. For added interest, this look features a strip of longer hair running down the back of the head that creates a subtle mohawk effect.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Slick-Comb-Over-205x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Highlights And Spikes;Another haircut from Harper's lighter haired days, this blonde look is a basic taper cut that's been left long enough on top to wear in spikes. For thicker haired men like Bryce, a strong hold product like a gel or pomade will be needed to maintain this kind of height and definition.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Highlights-and-Spikes-300x200.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Soft Side Part;One of the more relaxed styles we've seen Harper wear, this long on top look is softly parted, and styled with minimal product rather than being slicked into place. Tapered sides replace the ultra trendy undercut, making this a little more of a minimalist look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/soft-side-part-300x208.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Long Hair With Undercut;Channelling his inner Sons Of Anarchy style, this is one of the longest haircuts we've seen Bryce wear, extending about as far down as his jawline. The undercut sides help things look trendy as well as being a huge time saver when it comes to styling. For men who are new to wearing their hair longer, it's a good idea to start training your hair to be directed backwards instead of naturally falling into a part.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/long-hair-with-undercut-300x190.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Taper Cut With Rat Tail;This earlier haircut from Bryce Harper looks like a fairly basic taper cut except for the patch of longer hair left at the nape of the neck. An unconventional style like this is easier to pull off in a career path where professional appearance isn't as important, and it makes for a fun departure from the styles that every other guy is wearing. If you're transitioning from longer hair to a short cut, you could try this style out for a fun in between period.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/taper-cut-with-rat-tail-300x222.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Long Messy Style;Being in the middle of a baseball game probably has something to do with this messy style, but it makes for a nice change from the perfectly slicked back hair we're used to seeing. Longer hair can feel like it takes more work to style, but it's often easier to get away with a messy, tousled style when your strands are long enough that hair won't stick straight up on its own.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/long-and-messy-300x245.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;High Spikes;This sky-high spiky style depends on a strong, reliable product to keep in place. Try using a gel if you don't mind a hard, shiny texture to your finished style, or use a wax if you're after a more matte finish. Although some men use oil based pomades for vintage-inspired styles, we'd recommend sticking to water based products, as they're much easier to wash out when it's time to start your styling routine over again.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/High-and-Spiky-300x158.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;High And Tight Faded Sides;This skin faded style begins fairly high up, and is a great style option for men looking to slim the appearance of their faces. Hair on top is left longer and given a soft, tousled styling treatment that's made easier when thick hair is cut with textured layers.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/High-and-Tight-Faded-Sides-300x190.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Dark Brown Taper Cut;Before the legendary dirty blonde and sandy brown styles we see Bryce Harper wearing today, he was darker haired and fresher faced. This fairly classic taper cut looks ultra conservative compared to the closely shaved undercuts and high volume styles he's since become so popular for wearing.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/dark-brown-taper-cut-300x228.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-best-bryce-harper-haircut-looks/;Mega Volume Pompadour With Shaved Line Detail;One of Harper's most recent style incarnations, this impossibly high pompadour style is a massive styling feat that appears to defy gravity. If you're hoping to recreate this style at home, having thicker hair like Bryce's will make things much easier. Begin by working a mousse or other volumizing product through damp hair, then blow dry in an upward motion, working against the direction of your natural part if you have one. Once hair is dry, use a small amount of a paste or other tacky product to define the shape of your hair, being aware that adding too much can weigh it down. If you're looking for a long lasting style, finish your hair off with a maximum hold hairspray.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mega-volume-pompadour-with-line-detail-300x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Wavy Shag Style;Cut with two distinct layers, this short shag hairstyle is perfect for thick wavy hair, allowing it to be playful without looking too heavy around the neck. Not only is this a fairly low maintenance style, but it's a good goal for women who are trying to grow out a shorter pixie cut.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wavy-shag-style-222x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Wavy Chin Length Bob;Shorter bobs like this can be difficult to wear for women with thicker wavy hair, and often benefit from some undercutting to help keep things looking light and bouncy. If your hair has a looser wave pattern, we'd recommend going a bit longer to give the texture some room to shine.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Wavy-Chin-Length-Bob-271x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Classic Pixie With Waves;Take the classic pixie style worn by gamine icons like Audrey Hepburn and Anne Hathaway, and style it with some soft waves for a modern beachy take on the timeless crop. Use a curl defining product to encourage natural texture on the shortest pieces, and a skinny no-clamp curling wand on the longer face-framing strands.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Classic-Pixie-With-Waves-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Wavy Stacked Bob;While the typical stacked bob is styled with sleek, straight hair, we love this tousled wavy version of the style. This cut brings some softness to a look that's often seen as professional and serious, and also presents an option for wavy haired women who find longer styles difficult to manage.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Wavy-Stacked-Bob-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Wavy Faux-Hawk Pixie;This is a great style for anyone trying to elongate the appearance of their face, and is surprisingly easy to style thanks to how short it is on the sides. With significantly longer hair on top, this pixie is cut into a faux-hawk shape that gets accentuated by waves and curls that help add volume on top.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wavy-faux-hawk-pixie-296x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Glamour Bob With Waves;Put a sultry edge in your bob by adding some soft waves with a curling wand or flat iron. Don't stress too much about a uniform wave pattern all around, and concentrate your most defined curls around the face.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/glamour-bob-with-waves-292x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Wavy Blunt Bob;Fine hair is often cut into blunt bobs to maximize fullness, but that doesn't mean straight styling is the only option. Kelly Ripa's soft waves and side part are a great way to mix things up if your typical style is straight haired and centre parted.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wavy-blunt-bob-221x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Wavy Crop;A modern take on the Italian cut worn by '50s icons like Elizabeth Taylor and Sophia Loren, this wavy style is perfect for women who are looking to trade a younger looking cut for something more sophisticated and mature that still has sex appeal.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wavy-crop-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Tousled Waves With Short Bangs;Who says you need stick straight hair to make bangs work? Thanks to the piecey cut of these bangs, they work well with textured hair, and are especially flattering when framing oval shaped faces.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Tousled-Waves-With-Short-Bangs-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Thick Waves Bob;If you've got thick waves that are hard to control when worn long, cutting them into a chic bob can make styling simpler, and you'll won't feel like you're fighting with your hair. Depending on how coarse your hair is, a good stylist will be able to use textured ends or subtle layering to make hair look light and bouncy.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/thick-waves-bob-261x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Messy Waves Bob;The short-haired version of those lazy, barely-there waves we're used to seeing on longer locks, this messy blonde bob perfectly balances the harder edges of a dark lip and metallic dress.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/messy-waves-bob-260x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Shaggy Bob;With just enough wave so that the hair curls inward at the end of each layer, this shaggy bob is playful, sweet, and incredibly stylish. We especially love this cut with long, grown out bangs, but almost any fringe will work.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shaggy-bob-206x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Wavy Bob With Side Swept Bangs;With a deep side part and bangs that sweep across the brow, these bangs are especially flattering on women with heart shaped faces. Not only do they create a forehead minimizing angle, but fuller hair near the bottom half of the face helps widen the appearance of the jawline.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wavy-bob-with-side-swept-bangs-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Layered Waves Pixie;Being cropped very close at the back and sides allows the layered waves on top of this style to lightly sweep across the forehead. If you feel like going sleek for a day, this style is still long enough on top to style with a flat iron.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Layered-Waves-Pixie-220x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Shaggy Pixie;Want to grow out your shorted pixie but not sure what your in between style will look like? With a touch of tousled texture, thick bangs, and long hair in front of the ears, this shaggy pixie is laid back and fun.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shaggy-pixie-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Shoulder Grazing Waves;One of the longest styles on our list, these shoulder grazing waves are perfect for anyone with longer hair who's looking to slowly transition to a shorter style. This style can still go into a ponytail or braid, making it the best of both worlds.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Shoulder-grazing-waves-202x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Face Framing Waves;With just a few lazy waves added at the front of this centre parted lob, the style takes on a relaxed charm that makes a great everyday look.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Swept Pixie Waves;Hair with a wavy texture keeps pixies from looking flat while providing volume that can help alter the appearance of your face shape. If your hair is naturally straight, try adding waves with a skinny curling wand (don't use the clamp to avoid spiral curls or lines that are harder to hide in short hair), or tying hair in loose rag curls overnight.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/swept-pixie-waves-228x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Textured Waves;In a fairly blunt cut with textured ends, these waves add major depth and dimension to Kate Mara's chic blonde bob.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Soft Waves With Baby Bangs;With bangs this short, your styling options are fairly limited to being flat ironed straight or looking like a complete mess.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Wavy Layered Bob;Julianne Hough's hair has been setting trends for years, and this layered bob is no exception.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Inverted Bob With Waves;Longer in the front and shorter in the back, this inverted bob is perfect for women who already have some natural texture in their hair.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-wavy-hairstyles/;Gentle Wave Bob;With a gentle wave that lightly frames the face, this bob presents a quick option for straight haired women looking to add a bit of depth to their style without spending hours perfecting their waves before a night out.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gentle-wave-bob-243x300.png; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Classic Stacked Bob;With layers in the back and longer pieces in the front, this is a classic example of the stacked bob. For busy women, especially those with straight hair, this stacked bob is the perfect style for mixing ease with sophistication.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/classic-stacked-bob-300x258.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Classic Stacked Bob With Highlights;If you're looking to enhance your classic stacked bob haircut, try adding highlights throughout the top layer of hair. When properly placed by an expert colorist, the finished product will be a bob that looks impossibly thick.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/classic-stacked-bob-with-highlights-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Long In Front Stacked Bob;This burgundy bob features a more dramatic difference between lengths in the front and back, and a choppier technique is used throughout. With more distinct layers that don't seamlessly blend into each other, this stacked bob looks best on women looking for an edgier style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/long-in-front-stacked-bob-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Piecey Copper Stack;With lots of piecey layers, this stacked copper bob looks light as a feather, and is a perfect choice for women with straight hair that's resistant to heat styling.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/piecey-copper-stack-286x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Short Stacked Bob;In the shortest stacked bobs, hair is layered so high in the back that it's very closely cropped at the nape of the neck, and sometimes even undercut with clippers. Losing this much bulk can be tough for fine haired women, but it makes for a lighter and more manageable style if you were born with thicker hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/short-stacked-bob-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Red And Blonde Stacked Bob;The stacked layers in this cut are excellent for showing off dimensional color like this bob with pieces of red, copper and blonde. If you're going from long hair to a bob, be prepared to touch up color more frequently, as grown out roots tend to look sloppy on shorter styles.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/red-and-blonde-stacked-bob-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Stacked Bob With Bangs;Textured ends make the stacked layers in this cut look feather light, offering a perfect contrast to the straight blunt bangs.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Stacked A-Line Bob;Almost looking like two different haircuts, Victoria Beckham's iconic bob is cut with stacked layers in the back, while the front features longer pieces of a fairly uniform length. The final product has tons of structure, but still softly frames the face, leaving no surprise that this was one of the most copied celebrity haircuts ever.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/stacked-a-line-bob-259x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Stacked Bob With Long Pieces;The choppy cut of the layers in the back of this bob contrast nicely with the feathery texture of the longer pieces in front. Use of color is another interesting element seen here, with a deep copper shade applied to the longest pieces and through some layers in the back.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/stacked-bob-with-long-pieces-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Steep Angle Stacked Bob;To accommodate such a steep angle in a bob that's shorter than chin length, the back of this style has been strategically undercut. We love this stacked bob for thick haired women who are looking to shed some heaviness in their hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/steep-angle-stacked-bob-298x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Rainbow Stacked Bob;The stacked bob is a popular choice among professional women, but that doesn't mean it can't be mixed with trendy rainbow hues. This particular style features a vibrant mixture of pinks, violets, and greens, and the layered colors add extra depth to the style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Rainbow-Stacked-Bob-300x261.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Stacked Pixie Bob;Bob in the front and pixie in the back, this hybrid style is ideal for busy, professional women who are serious about their hairstyle but short on time to get ready in the morning.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/stacked-pixie-bob-296x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Stacked Bob With Side Shave;Looking like a classic stacked bob from one side and an edgy undercut on the other, this haircut makes a bold style statement. If you're dying to try this style but concerned about growing out an undercut later on, make your side shave low enough that it can be hidden by adjusting your part and covering it with longer pieces of hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/stacked-bob-with-side-shave-290x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Layered Honey Bob;This layered bob is light and bouncy in the front, with feathery textured face framing pieces in a warm honey color.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Close Cropped Stack;Another bob/pixie hybrid, this stacked bob haircut loses all length at the nape of the neck, making for a crisp, presentable style. You'll need to get frequent trims to maintain this style, as grown out hair at the nape of the neck can look sloppy quite quickly.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/close-cropped-stack-214x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Touch Of Pink Bob;This young, fun take on a stacked bob haircut features a faint touch of pink at some of the ends, proving that playful styles don't have to be over the top.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Touch-of-Pink-Bob-282x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Wavy Stacked Style;Dressing up a stacked bob can be tough, since they're usually too short to put in an updo.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Ombre Bob;If you want to try an ombre color with your stacked bob, try opting for a haircut that's on the longer side, and choose an ombre color that flatters and compliments your skin tone.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ombre-Bob-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Burgundy Stacked Style;This classic stacked bob haircut gets a dose of fun with a rich, burgundy color that'll help it stand out from the pack.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/burgungy-stacked-style-300x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Geometric Stacked Bob;Putting a unique and ultra edgy spin on the typical stacked bob haircut, this style features a geometric cut-out around the ear with some shaved undercutting beneath. You can make this an asymmetrical style or try the cut-outs on each side, being prepared that this detail will make your hair difficult to grow out into a longer style that can be tied into an updo.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/geometric-stacked-bob-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Glam Bob;With maximum volume all around, this glamorous stacked bob looks like a short-haired version of a big, Southern Belle hairstyle.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/glam-bob-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Tousled Stacked Bob;For anyone who hates dealing with a flat iron in the morning, this style is proof that a stacked bob doesn't have to be worn with super straight hair. Apply a mousse or texturizing cream to damp hair, and blow dry on a low setting without using a brush to achieve this perfectly tousled look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tousled-stacked-bob-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Stacked Bob With Undercut;The layers in the back of this haircut come just high enough to show off an undercut nape, making the style edgy without being too over the top. Once you've tried this style out, you might want to go higher in the back next time you get trimmed, but this is a great starting point for newcomers to a shaved nape style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Stacked-bob-with-undercut-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Bouncy Stacked Bob;Full of layers that provide a crazy amount of volume, this bouncy stacked bob is proof that shorter haircuts don't have to look overly sleek or ironed down.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/bouncy-stacked-bob-224x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-stacked-bob-haircuts/;Long Stacked Bob;Longer than a typical stacked bob, this style features almost no layering in the longer, face framing pieces, while softly stacked layers are still present in the back. This longer style is a great choice for women who are trying out their first stacked bob haircut.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/long-stacked-bob-200x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/fabulous-50s-hairstyles/;Glamour Curls;In a decade when long hair was for young girls, above the shoulder cuts signalled grown-up sex appeal.

http://hairstylehub.com/fabulous-50s-hairstyles/;High Glamour Ponytail;For women who didn't opt for short hair in the '50s, high ponytails were the trendiest way to wear your longer locks.

http://hairstylehub.com/fabulous-50s-hairstyles/;Piecey Bang Pixie;Inspired by Audrey Hepburn's iconic pixie, this short style is perfect if you're looking for a dramatic way to change up your look while keeping your hair in a classic style. Pixies like this are especially flattering on women with oval and heart shaped faces, and the piecey bangs can help to minimize a larger forehead while being easier to style than bangs that are thick or bluntly cut.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/piecey-bang-pixie-202x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/fabulous-50s-hairstyles/;Brushed Back Pixie;Another style inspired by Audrey Hepburn, this pixie is styled with hair brushed back and away from the face. This classic style puts your face completely on display, and requires a lot of confidence to pull off. For first time pixie wearers, we'd recommend a style with longer pieces in front before graduating to a look this bold.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/brushed-back-pixie-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/fabulous-50s-hairstyles/;Curled Bob With Deep Side Part;Copy Taylor Swift's vintage style for the perfect mix of youth and Old Hollywood glam.

http://hairstylehub.com/fabulous-50s-hairstyles/;Edgy Pompadour;For short haired women who aren't interested in the demure pixie style, why not try a pompadour as made popular by the greaser subculture of the '50s. When mixed with this platinum hue and a modern, edgy undercut, this pompadour looks stylishly crisp, and definitely not stuck in the past.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/edgy-pompadour-215x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/fabulous-50s-hairstyles/;Finger Wave Bob;This style sneaks in some vintage flair with finger waves near the roots, but allows the ends of curls to fall in a more modern, spiral curl.

http://hairstylehub.com/fabulous-50s-hairstyles/;Blonde Bouffant;This high-piled style was a glamorous, more mature way to wear hair in a 1950s updo.

http://hairstylehub.com/25-vintage-glam-flapper-hairstyles/;Low Side Style;If you're trying to pull off a flapper-inspired look with longer hair, try a low updo that creates a silhouette similar to bob length styles.

http://hairstylehub.com/25-vintage-glam-flapper-hairstyles/;Chin Length Bob With Bangs;This incredibly chic bob is cut to just above chin length, and has some texture in the ends to keep it from looking too thick or helmet-like. The shape of this cut tends to accentuate any roundness in the face, so you may want to choose a different style if you're trying to camouflage fuller cheeks.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chin-length-bob-237x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/25-vintage-glam-flapper-hairstyles/;Embellished Headband;Because beaded and bejewelled headbands were a staple of flapper nightlife fashion, adding one to your hair brings instant vintage appeal, and means you can spend less time worrying about keeping every hair perfectly in place.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/embellished-headband-300x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Bumper Bangs Updo;A classic element of pin up hairstyles, bumper bangs are rolled inwards towards the face, creating a Bettie Page style bang without any cutting involved. Women with thick hair can achieve this style without any padding, but those with thin hair can use a cut apart hair donut to create volume and structure in the rolled bangs.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/bumper-bangs-updo-245x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Victory Roll Updo;With two big rolls, one over and one under, this updo is a bold, stylish choice to pair with a vintage dress for a special occasion, or a '40s themed wedding look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/victory-roll-updo-300x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Loose Curls With Headscarf;Adding this cute headscarf to hair that's been styled in loose spiral curls is an easy way to add instant pin up factor to your style.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Curled Style With Headscarf;Set your mid-length hair in hot rollers, then unwrap and brush out once cooled to get these big, vintage curls.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Headscarf Style With Rolled Bangs;Because most of your hair will be covered with a headscarf, this pin up style is perfect for days when you're short on time, or your mane just isn't cooperating. To get real staying power on rolled bangs with this much height, use liberal amounts of hairspray, and bring a mini bottle with you for touch-ups throughout the day.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Headscarf-Style-With-Rolled-Bangs-300x300.jpg; ;

Get these big, soft curls by setting hair in hot rollers then gently brushing out curls and spraying into place after rollers have cooled. If you're looking for a quick way to add a bow to your style, look for hair pieces already attached to a headband or hair clips.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/glam-bob-with-bow-261x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Face Framing Rolls;This style is perfect for anyone trying out victory rolls for the first time, because you won't be styling behind your head where it's difficult to see, and the final product doesn't have to be perfect.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Face-Framing-Rolls-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Pin Up Birdcage Style;Mid length hair is the ideal canvas for getting this pin up style that's all rolled into an updo.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Long Waves With Short Bangs;We love the dramatic contrast between waist-length hair and short Bettie Page bangs. If you want to try this style for a day without committing, try adding extensions for more length and opt for a curled or bumper bang style instead of permanently cutting yours.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/long-waves-with-short-bangs-200x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Pastel Purple Victory Rolls;Using large sections to form two victory rolls on each side of the face, this demure vintage hairstyle is balanced nicely with an ultra trendy muted pastel hair color.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pastel-purple-victory-rolls-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Brushed Curls With Short Blunt Bangs;In an ultra glamorous style that would make Bettie Page proud, these dark locks are styled into perfectly brushed out curls, and offset by dramatic blunt bangs.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Aqua Pin Curl Bob;In another example of mixing modern hair color trends with vintage pin up styling, this look could be your everyday go-to, or something you keep on hand for special occasions.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Ultra Glam Rolled Curled Updo;The big victory roll on top of this style adds height and dimension to this updo, while loose softer pieces styled at the back help to give it some romantic flair.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Pin Up Style For Shorter Hair;All over rolled styles can be difficult to pull off with bob length hair, making this a great style option for women with shorter hair, especially if it's longer on top. Create one roll with the middle section of hair, then slick back or pin the sides, depending on how long your hair is.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Pinup-Style-for-Shorter-Hair-198x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Soft Brushed Waves;If you're looking for a more timeless pin up inspired hairstyle, try these soft brushed waves.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Rolled Style With Bettie Bangs;With big victory rolls and Bettie bangs, this is a very vintage look that can be tough to mix with more modern styling.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Cobalt Blue Pin Up Do;This updo looks glamorous now, but is based on styles that became popular in the '40s when women began to work in factories during the second world war.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Pin Up Ponytail;This high ponytail updo keeps hair out of your way all day, but looks more sophisticated and sexy than your average pony. If you have longer bangs or none at all, try creating the same face framing style by styling a piece of hair up and then tucking under the headscarf as pictured here.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pin-up-ponytail-1-300x248.png; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Pinned Jumbo Rolls;Mixing '40s glamour with cheeky pin up style, this rolled look has each hair perfectly in place. If you're new to these styling techniques, we recommend trying something more simple until you've had some practice pinning rolls in place.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pinned-jumbo-rolls-1-214x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pin-up-hairstyles/;Spiral Curls Updo;For a quick pin up hairstyle that's flirty and fun, use a silky headscarf to tie up your spiral curled hair.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;;Tom Hardy is usually seen in more closely cropped cuts, but this slicked back mid-length style was one of his best looks. His style here is more classic than the modern slick popular in hipster culture, and this effect was probably created using lots of pomade and plenty of combing.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Classic-Slick-Back-211x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;;This style is not as aggressively slicked back, and the hair's natural texture is allowed to carry this look. This medium cut forgoes the popular undercut, making it a good option for men in the process of growing their hair long. Tucking hair behind the ears helps to showcase the face and clean the style up for more formal events.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Natural-Slick-Back-274x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;Tapered Cut With Curls On Top;This cut with shorter sides and longer, messy curls on top makes for a very low maintenance, but stylish look.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;Curly Disconnected Undercut Hairstyle;This technical cut is best achieved by working with a stylist who you know and trust, as any flaw in the line delineating this undercut will ruin the whole look. Although this cut could also be achieved with straighter hair, the longer curls provide an interesting juxtaposition of textures against the other lengths of hair here. Also not for the faint of heart are these curls that fall into the face, giving a modern Edward Scissorhands vibe.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/medium-length-hair-men-235x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;Medium Straight Layers;The jagged texture of this cut is perfect for men with lots of thick, straight hair who are interested in going to a medium length without too much bulk. Chris' sandy colored locks make this look come off as beachy business casual. Less frequent washing will help give hair some of the grit needed to pull this style together perfectly, but beware that too much natural oil can take this style from god-like to greasy.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Medium-Straight-Layers-202x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;Undercut With Design and Bald Fade;A lot of skill and precision go into executing a cut like this. Use a barber or stylist you trust, and don't let any amateurs near your head if this is the look you're going for. On top is a textured cut with highlights throughout, while tapered sides disappearing into a bald fade making this a little edgier than your standard undercut. The stylist will then use scissors, clippers, or a straight razor to precisely etch in the line you're after. Undercuts can be awkward to grow out, and once this line starts to look fuzzy you'll want your stylist or barber to redo it, or adjust the entire fade to make the line disappear completely.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Undercut-Design-Fade-240x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;Dreamboat Waves;This timeless cut for men with curly hair has signalled power since the days of the Roman Empire. In a modern setting, these natural curls are at the perfect length to show off their texture without looking clownish or becoming unmanageable. Sideburns and a slightly shorter cut in the back are details that help to round out this cut.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dreamboat-Waves-199x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;Swept Back Waves;For hair with a natural wave that don't evolve into outright curls, this medium length style is polished and professional.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;Messy Tendrils;For a wild, carefree look, this hair is only slightly pushed back, and allowed to fall around the face and ears. Don't expect to be able to achieve this style simply by growing out short hair. The overall effect isn't sloppy thanks to a deliberate cut that brings hair shorter on the sides and back without turning into a traditional undercut.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Messy-Tendrils-236x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;Shaggy Cut;This dark look is shaggy but not bulky thanks to textured ends. Copper highlights throughout are subtle enough to look naturally sunkissed, and help to make the cut look more lightweight than it would on someone with flat color. Shaggy cuts tend to be most often seen on younger men, and anyone approaching middle age or working in a professional setting should consider going with a more controlled style for their medium hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Shaggy-Cut-278x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;Modern Pompadour;This is a volume driven look that requires relatively thick hair and a commitment to daily styling. While not as meticulously coiffed as the classic pompadour â think Elvis Presley â this style still requires deliberate cutting to create shape and movement on top while remaining clean underneath. In this version, the hair is allowed to fall into it's natural part on top instead of being slicked into submission.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Natural-Undercut-257x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;Medium Taper Cut;If you're looking for sexy yet elegant male haircuts, why not try this slick taper cut? A naturally wavy texture helps to make this medium taper cut look so dapper. If your hair is very straight, wearing this style may cause it to look flat. No matter your hair texture, nobody rolls out of bed looking this good, and the style requires work. Blowdrying will help add volume before working in a wax to create natural looking hold while keeping each hair perfectly in place.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Medium-Taper-Cut-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;Medium Curly Layers;While many modern men's cuts feature hair that's at least partially swept back, this more natural style is parted just off of centre, and actually allows curls to fall around the ears and frame the face. This medium style is perfect for men who want to look good without subjecting themselves to the whims of the trendy.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Medium-Curly-Layers-272x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/20-medium-length-hairstyles-for-men/;Natural Undercut;In this breezy look, hair is shorter on the sides, but not to the extent of the classic undercut. Hair on top is messily flipped back rather than being carefully placed into position. Bike rides, hikes, or kayaking trips won't wreak havoc on this hairstyle, making it a great choice for men with an active daily lifestyle, or those who simply can't be bothered to primp and preen each morning.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Natrual-Undercut-210x300.jpg; ;

We love this style for thick haired women who are looking for a bob haircut that doesn't feel chunky, and the raven shade mixed with an edgier short cut makes the style look like it was ripped from the pages of a comic book.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/short-choppy-bob-with-bangs-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/25-inverted-bob-haircuts/;Chin Length Bob;This honey colored bob has become Mary J Blige's signature hairstyle. It's a great choice for anyone wanting to feel chic and put together in a professional setting, or looking to move away from a more immature look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/chin-length-bob-226x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/25-inverted-bob-haircuts/;Inverted Bob With Baby Bangs;Pairing these bangs with an inverted bob makes for a deliberate style that never looks lazy. These super short baby bangs are a bold choice that come with amazing results, putting focus on your eyes and taking years off of your appearance. If you're thinking about taking the plunge, consider that they'll require daily styling unless you have pin-straight hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/inverted-bob-with-baby-bangs-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/25-inverted-bob-haircuts/;Green Ombre Bob;With all sorts of rainbow hues being worn right now, this green ombre bob looks chic and not overly edgy. The combination of black hair with a turquoise green ombre is especially eye-catching, but requires chemical lightening beforehand, and is best left in the hands of a trusted professional stylist.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/green-ombre-bob-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/25-inverted-bob-haircuts/;Purple Streak Bob;If you want to add a pop of color to your bob without going for ombre or all over highlighting, try adding a streak of color to the longer pieces that frame your face. Because this is a subtle look, it might be one you want to attempt at home, especially if you've got lighter hair that won't require bleaching beforehand.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/purple-streak-bob-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/25-inverted-bob-haircuts/;Soft Red Bob;The soft bang in this bob helps balance out the sleek aspects of the chin length look. We especially love this muted red shade, which makes a nice alternative to intense red colors that can look harsh against some skin tones. As with any red, this color tends to fade fast, but shampooing less frequently with sulphate free products can help preserve your shade.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/soft-red-bob-300x293.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/25-inverted-bob-haircuts/;Inverted Espresso Lob;This inverted lob features a dramatic difference in length between back and front, making it easy to wear up or down. The ends have texture added to keep them from looking too thick or bulky, but won't make fine haired women feel like they've lost volume.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/espresso-Lob-252x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/25-inverted-bob-haircuts/;Red Ombre Bob;Touches of red ombre at the ends of this bob help to highlight the subtle angle and add an extra pop of colour. An intense red shade like this looks especially nice against deeper skin tones, while fair skinned women might want to opt for a lighter, gingery hue.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/red-ombre-bob-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/25-inverted-bob-haircuts/;Asymmetrical Inverted Bob;This inverted bob has an asymmetrical detail that sets it apart from an everyday cut. This edgy silhouette makes the perfect style if you're looking for a new, unique detail that doesn't involve drastically changing your hair's color.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/asymmetrical-inverted-bob-300x228.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/25-inverted-bob-haircuts/;Inverted Lob With Bangs;With very contrasting lengths from back to front, this cut is ideal for straight styling. The thick bangs that land just below the eyebrows are a great choice for anyone trying to shorten the appearance of their face, and they allow more room for error in styling compared to shorter bangs.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/inverted-lob-with-bangs-212x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/25-inverted-bob-haircuts/;Purple Pastel Bob;If you're looking for a chic cut with a bold edge, try mixing the classic silhouette of an inverted bob with this ultra trendy silvery pastel shade. This silvery lavender shade looks nice against complexions with warm undertones, while extra fair ladies may want to opt for a warmer, peachy shade.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/pastel-silver-bob-267x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;High Blonde Ombre;Since she went blonde in 2015, Khloe Kardashian has been setting trends with every new cut or color she wears. These blonde ombre lengths with a slightly darker base color are one of the best examples of just how sophisticated the color trend can look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/high-blonde-ombre-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Ashy Brunette With Blonde Ombre;This blonde ombre style creates a bold contrast between golden blonde ends and a natural ashy brunette base. If your blonde ombre starts higher than your chin and will be right against your face, consider your skin tone when choosing a shade of blonde. Warm golden tones tend to look best against medium or dark skin, while fairer complexions can handle very light platinum tones.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ashy-Brunette-with-blonde-ombre-240x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Warm Honey Ombre;The warm, rich tones in Emily Blunt's honey colored ombre help to bring out her peachy cheeks. Try this style out if you're looking to transition your brunette shade for a new season.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Warm-Honey-Ombre-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Copper Blonde Dip Dye;If you're looking for a blonde ombre hair color that's decidedly unnatural looking, try going for a dip dye style. Just as simple as it sounds, this technique involves dipping the ends of your hair in a new color, and doesn't involve any blending or graduated color. Try this ombre style at home, or head to the salon if you're looking for a blonde dip dye that's perfectly even all around.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Copper-Blonde-Dip-Dye-300x225.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Espresso and Honey Blonde;Longer hair allows more room to play with ombre colors, and you don't have to be as concerned with how the blonde tone will look up against your face. Jessie J uses this to her full advantage, framing her face with the striking espresso color that makes her eyes pop, and using a honey blonde color on the lower half of her hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Espresso-and-Honey-blonde-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Gradient Flame;This transition from dark blue-red at the roots to golden blonde ends makes for a bold, fiery color palette. Red tones are among the hardest to keep from fading away, so this style will have you thinking about aftercare both in terms of keeping your bright red from fading, and nurturing ends that may be dried out in the bleaching process.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gradient-flame-237x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Subtle Dip Dye Bob;While dip dye ombre usually features a bold contrast between two shades, this look uses a darker honey blonde that isn't dramatically lighter than the rest of the hair. If you've got long ombre hair that's in need of a chop, you might be able to achieve this look without any color touch up at all.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Subtle-Dip-Dye-Bob-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Dirty Blonde Ombre;This style strikes a nice balance between the eye-catching color dynamic and the natural, ashy look of both roots and ends.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Dirty-Blonde-Ombre-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Subtle Ombre Bob;Natalie Portman's subtle blonde ombre is most obvious when hair is styled straight, but you can downplay the contrasting color by wearing hair in waves or curls.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Subtle-Ombre-Bob-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Strawberry Blonde Ombre;As if this peachy pink hair wouldn't be bold enough on its own, this look sees it combined with a strawberry blonde ombre. This is a great way to shake things up if you love ombre hair but want something funkier than a blonde and brunette combination.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Strawberry-Blonde-Ombre-240x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Espresso With Platinum Ombre;This platinum ombre is about as light as blonde shades come, making for a bold statement when combined with rich espresso hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Espresso-With-Platinum-Ombre-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;High Contrast Dip Dye;If you can't decide on one warm shade to wear your hair in, try this high contrast dip dye with warm golden blonde over chocolatey brunette. If you don't want to see a solid line between colors when hair is worn straight, dip dye in small pieces and each will end up at a slightly different height.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/High-Contrast-Dip-Dye-197x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Red To Blonde Ombre Bob;Not only does this blonde ombre help a red bob to look even more bold, but the bleaching process can actually plump up the ends of hair. If your ends are damaged, we'd recommend giving hair a break before lightening, as this can make them split even further.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Red-To-Blonde-Ombre-Bob-300x297.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Platinum Ombre;This blonde ombre style is ultra chic, and features platinum ends over a cool medium brunette. Because this look features two different colors right up against the face, it's important to consider how each shade will play against your skin tone.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/platinum-ombre-191x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Blonde On Black Lob;This blonde ombre hue looks surprisingly sophisticated in combination with Vanessa Hudgens' nearly black roots. When paired with dark clothing and gothic-chic makeup (think dark berry lips and smudgy black liner), a blonde ombre adds warmth and dimension to the look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Blonde-On-Black-Lob-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Auburn With Butter Ombre;If you've been blessed with hair that's naturally auburn in color, blonde ombre is the perfect way to reinvigorate your hairstyle without an all-over color makeover.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Auburn-With-Butter-Ombre-177x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Blonde On Black Ombre;This blonde ombre over a black base color is about as bold as you can go. If you're trying to lighten dark brown or black hair, applying a toner after bleaching is usually necessary to keep things from looking orange or brassy, and this high-stakes ombre job is best left to a professional.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Blonde-on-Black-Ombre-186x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Blonde Ombre Curls;Blonde ombre is a great way to punch up curly hair, whether that means chemically lightening your natural curls, or installing ombre dyed hair for a crochet braided style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Blonde-Ombre-Curls-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Blonde On Blonde Ombre;This summery style layers light blonde ombre over Lauren Conrad's signature shade of dark sandy blonde. The two-toned blonde effect here makes for a more subtle but sunny ombre style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Blonde-On-Blonde-Ombre-224x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Long Dirty Blonde Ombre;This golden blonde ombre over dirty blonde hair makes for a bold look that's perfect for warming things up in the summer or when you're looking to do some color experimentation.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Long-Dirty-Blonde-Ombre-202x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Warm Blonde Over Cool Brunette;If you're looking for a bold fusion of edgy and beachy hairstyles, try this cool brunette with thick bangs paired with a warm blonde ombre.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cool-Brown-Warm-Blonde-Ombre-300x200.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Barely There Blonde Ombre;This bob with a hint of blonde ombre is quite a change of pace for Katharine McPhee, who usually wears her hair long and dark. Unlike a dip dyed bob with a bold contrasting color, the blonde ombre here very subtle, and mostly concentrated around the face.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Barely-There-Ombre-213x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Sandy Bob With Platinum Ombre;Another lovely example of blonde on blonde ombre, this style features a nice gradual transition from a sandy shade at the roots to pale platinum pieces throughout the ends.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Sandy-Bob-With-Platinum-Ombre-210x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Sun-Kissed Ombre Bob;One of the most natural looking styles on our list, this bob has subtle touches of blonde ombre that expertly mimic sun-kissed highlights.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Mid Length Blonde Ombre;A pale blonde ombre brightens up this warm auburn style, and keeps things interesting even when hair is thrown into a casual, half-up style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mid-length-blonde-ombre-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Half And Half Blonde Ombre;In a very goth-chic color twist, this style uses black and platinum blonde hair to create a unique half-and-half ombre. Try this one out if you love attention and are looking for an incredibly bold color style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/half-and-half-blonde-ombre-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Bold Ombre Bob;We love how brazen this blonde ombre looks over dark brunette hair with thick bangs.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Pink-Blonde Ombre;The pink-blonde ombre on this mid-length cut looks like strawberry lemonade, and could be an appropriate choice in any season thanks to the bold contrast between light and dark shades.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Pink-Blonde-Ombre-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;Rapunzel Ombre;One of the perks of growing your hair insanely long (or wearing extensions), is that you have tons of room to experiment with ombre color. This platinum ombre will freshen up your ultra long locks without sacrificing any length, and makes for even prettier french or dutch braided styles.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/rapunzel-ombre-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-blonde-ombre-hair-ideas/;High Ombre Bob;This high contrast blonde ombre begins quite far up the hair's length, and could almost be mistaken for color that's grown out at the roots. Some face framing pieces of blonde that begin higher up help to add a sense of purpose to this bold, rule-breaking blonde ombre.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/high-ombre-bob-274x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Ultra Preppy Ivy League;With a defined side part and hair carefully styled into place, this Ivy League haircut looks straight out of prep school. Although it feels particularly at home with a collared shirt or sweater, you'll be surprised how good this Ivy League style looks with edgier streetwear like motorcycle and bomber jackets.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ultra-preppy-ivy-league-213x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Tousled Quiff Ivy League;Leaving your Ivy League cut longer on top allows for more styling options, like this perfectly tousled quiff. If your hair doesn't look quite this good when you roll out of bed, try blowdrying in an upward motion to add volume, then finish with a styling cream or texturizing paste to get soft hold all day.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tousled-quiff-ivy-league-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Modern Edge Ivy League;This cut plays with the typical dimensions of an Ivy League, leaving hair very short on the sides, while the top is still long enough to be parted or styled over to one side.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/modern-ivy-league-224x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Hollywood Ivy League;If you want your Ivy League haircut to look as put together as possible, take note of Zac Efron's dapper Hollywood style. With a deep side part and perfectly sculpted bangs, this hairstyle will set you apart from the men who are into minimal effort hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hollywood-ivy-league-300x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Young Ivy League;By leaving hair fairly short around the back and sides, this is one of the easiest Ivy League haircuts to wear, and will have you looking clean cut with very little effort. To get the young effect, gently style longer pieces on top with a soft hold product for an effortless, bed-head appeal.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/young-ivy-league-229x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Classic Side Part;With hair left at least a few inches long at the sides, this Ivy League style takes on a classic silhouette, and is a great choice for middle aged men who prefer timelessness over trends.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/classic-side-part-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Tight Sides Ivy League;Somewhere between an Ivy League and a crew cut, this style keeps things tight at the sides, but leaves hair long enough on top to style up and into place.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/tight-sides-ivy-league-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Ivy League Undercut;If you're looking to add some edge to your Ivy League style, consider mixing it up with an undercut at the back and sides instead of a classic taper. This haircut is great for young men who are invested in keeping up with trends, and makes for much quicker styling time.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ivy-league-undercut-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Messy Ivy League;This messy Ivy League style walks a fine line between 'classic haircut' and 'artfully messy'. Pair it with a suit and tie to keep your look fun and approachable, or make this your everyday Ivy League style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/messy-ivy-league-205x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Lumberjack Ivy League;Combining this low-key haircut with a scruffy beard and casual clothing (plaid preferred!) shows that the Ivy League doesn't only fit with prep school styles.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lumberjack-ivy-league-207x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Dark And Sultry;Leaving hair longer on top can sometimes come across as a younger, immature style, but when worn with well-tailored clothing and rich chestnut hair, this dark and sultry style is about as far from 'boy band' as you can get.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dark-and-sultry-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Silver Ivy League;George Clooney's salt and pepper mane is always stylish, but we particularly love the dapper Ivy League haircut he's been wearing lately.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Ivy League Quiff;With hair about five inches or longer on top, your Ivy League haircut can be styled into an easy quiff. Make it your everyday look, or keep it on reserve for special occasions or days when you have extra time to style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ivy-league-quiff-200x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Ivy League For Thick Hair;While some men with thick hair prefer to keep it super short and avoid styling altogether, a good stylist can add texture to your Ivy League, helping you show off that naturally thick hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ivy-league-for-thick-hair-300x255.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Ivy League Fade;Another modification on the traditional Ivy League, this style keeps it classic on top, but features a high and tight fade at the back and sides. We love this look for easy styling or anyone who likes to go longer in between hair cuts.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ivy-league-fade-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Sculpted Ivy League;Using a stronger hold product than we typically see with an Ivy League results in this super sculpted look that actually looks edgier and more daring than the softer styles.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/scultped-ivy-league-228x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Vintage Ivy League;With an unbelievably perfect swoop in front, this parted Ivy League has tons of vintage charm, but will add styling time to your morning routine. Leaving hair this long on top means your haircut probably won't be a 'wash and go', but we love this look for guys who are looking to up their style game.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/vintage-ivy-league-229x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Brushed Up Ivy League;If you're looking for a young, fun way to style your Ivy League haircut, try this brushed up style.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-ivy-league-haircut-styles-and-ideas/;Beckham Ivy League;Because almost no list is complete without David Beckham, here's his Ivy League style from a few years back. Mixing softly spiked styling with an Ivy League haircut makes this look young, modern, and classic all at once.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Beckham-Ivy-League-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Softly Spiked Faux Hawk;Channing Tatum's softly spiked faux hawk is more about styling than how it's cut, making it easy to recreate with a fairly classic short haircut. If you don't have a chiseled face like Channing, styling your hair like this will help to elongate and open up your face.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Softly-spiked-faux-hawk-300x259.jpeg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Sporty Faux Hawk;David Beckham popularized the faux hawk style in the early '00s, and since then it's been seen all over the place. Becks' version features a longer strip of hair down the middle of the head all the way from the forehead to the nape of the neck, while hair on the sides is shorter, but not so much that scalp is visible.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Sporty-Faux-hawk-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Burst Fade Faux Hawk;If you love your hair's natural texture but also appreciate the clean lines of a precise fade cut, this faux hawk brings both into one look. The burst fade helps to create a mohawk shape, and line details in the sideburns add an extra dose of style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/low-fade-faux-hawk-300x297.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Barely There Faux Hawk;Adam Levine's super short style has a hint of faux hawk shape, as it gradually tapers in length from the middle of the head outwards.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Tapered Faux Hawk;A certified hair icon since his teen years, Zac Efron's turn with the faux hawk showed off his young, fun personality, and did a nice job of complimenting his face shape. With tapered sides similar to a classic crew cut, this is one of the most approachable ways to wear a faux hawk.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/faux-hawk-taper-228x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Messy Faux Hawk;This geek-chic style comes from a haircut that's close to a uniform length all around.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Slicked Faux Hawk;Cristiano Ronaldo wore his faux hawk slicked into place, more reminiscent of a punky cut than the softer faux hawk style. Although he's moved on from the look, this edgy style is still closely associated with the Portugese football star.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Slick-faux-hawk-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Side Sweep Faux Hawk;With hair that's at least four inches long on top, this faux hawk is styled with minimal product by sweeping hair over to one side. The strip of longer hair in the back requires minimal styling as it's kept shorter than up top, but is still long enough to create a mohawk shape.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/side-sweep-faux-hawk--300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Subtle Faux Hawk Fade;Zayn Malik's faux hawk is created by styling hair on top in an upward motion, while a drop fade around the back creates the same shape as a traditional mohawk, without actually having a longer piece running down the back of the head.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/subtle-faux-hawk-fade-300x214.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Faux Hawk Fade With Nape Design;Looking fairly close to a traditional mohawk, this style is faded at the sides instead of being uniformly shaved down to the scalp. Designs shaved into the nape of the neck help accentuate the mohawk shape without looking distracting or overwhelming.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mohawk-fade-nape-design-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Textured Faux Hawk Fade;Longer hair on top has been cut with lots of texture, allowing it to be styled upwards without weighing itself down.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Swept Back Faux Hawk;This haircut has the same basic elements as the popular undercut style: longer hair on top with dramatically shorter hair at the back and sides. Because the long hair on top doesn't taper in length from front to back, it creates a subtle mohawk shape when styled swept backwards.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Swept-back-faux-hawk-231x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Dramatic Faux Hawk Fade;These natural curls have been cut to create a mohawk shape down the middle of the head, with the longest pieces of hair being styled straight for maximum effect, and setting this style apart from other curly faux hawks.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dramatic-faux-hawk-fade-194x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Softly Brushed Faux Hawk;Another faux hawk look from Adam Levine, this style looks as though it's been softly brushed into place, and was probably styled with some artful blowdrying and sparing use of styling cream or texturizing paste.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/softly-brushed-faux-hawk-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Spiky Faux Hawk;Styled into spiky perfection, this faux hawk looks a lot like a classic mohawk except for its lack of shaved sides.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Slicked Back Faux Hawk;Leaving hair much longer on top allows it to be styled into a mohawk shape when slicked backwards.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Long Curls Faux Hawk;With longer natural curls styled up into a mohawk shape, this look proves a faux hawk can work with any texture of hair, and doesn't require losing tons of length at the sides.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/long-curls-faux-hawk-226x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Slick Faux Hawk Undercut;This dramatic styling brings hair to a sharp point in the middle of the head, making it a bold choice that doesn't suit every circumstance. It's fun to try out, but we'd suggest choosing another style for your wedding day.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/slick-faux-hawk-undercut-250x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Curly Faux Hawk Fade;With a fairly wide section of hair being left longer on top, this style only creates a minimal mohawk shape, making it a good choice for your first try wearing the style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/curly-faux-hawk-fade-300x283.jpeg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Sculpted Faux Hawk;Once natural hair with tight curls is cut into a faux hawk style like this one, it requires little to no styling effort, making it a great choice for men who don't want to deal with the maintenance involved with growing their hair longer.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/sculpted-faux-hawk-238x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Spiky Faux Hawk Fade;Styled into crisp spikes on top and with a drop fade at the back, this faux hawk style accentuates the longer hair at the front while featuring only a minimalistic mohawk shape in the back.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/spiky-faux-hawk-fade-223x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;High Drama Faux Hawk;Between the high styled hair in the front and longer pieces in front of the ears, this faux hawk style looks like it belongs to a character in a graphic novel.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Low Key Faux Hawk;This haircut isn't styled into a dramatic faux hawk shape, but its burst fade pattern creates a low key mohawk silhouette, making it a great choice for your everyday style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/low-key-faux-hawk-300x253.png; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Bleached Blonde Faux Hawk;K-Pop star T.O.P's bleached blonde faux hawk worn in a pompadour is pop-star style at its finest.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-faux-hawk-haircuts-for-men/;Faux Hawk Fade With Line Detail;This style is fairly subtle when it comes to the mohawk shape, but has the added style elements of a skin fade and shaved line detail to keep things interesting.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/faux-hawk-fade-with-line-detail-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-quiff-haircuts-for-men/;Dapper Quiff;We've seen David Beckham styling this longer on top haircut in both a pompadour and comb over style.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-quiff-haircuts-for-men/;Hard Part Quiff;This style has a pronounced shape thanks to the hard part shaved into one side, after which hair is tapered at a fairly steep angle.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-quiff-haircuts-for-men/;Short Quiff;Proving that you don't need dramatically longer hair on top to wear a quiff style, Tom Hiddleston's style brushes his short ginger hair up and away from the face in a more sophisticated version of the quiff.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Short-Quiff-300x212.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-quiff-haircuts-for-men/;Taper Cut Quiff;As a fairly basic tapered cut that's longer on top, this haircut can be styled into a quiff as pictured, but also lends itself nicely to a soft side parted look. Having that versatility can be especially valuable for men in professions where a young, fun hairstyle isn't always appropriate.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/quiff-taper-cut-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-quiff-haircuts-for-men/;Shaggy Quiff;Eddie Redmayne's haircut leaves the sides almost as long as at the top, allowing them to be styled towards the face.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-quiff-haircuts-for-men/;High Fashion Quiff;Brushed upwards in a carefree but not messy way, this high fashion style shows off hair with dimensional highlights in front.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-quiff-haircuts-for-men/;Sculpted Quiff With Hard Part;This sophisticated quiff is carefully styled with every hair in its place.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-quiff-haircuts-for-men/;Color Contrast Quiff;Zayn Malik's quiff is styled messily upwards, leaving a soft natural finish rather than a precisely slicked style. The real star of this look is the stark color contrast between his natural black roots and the bleach blonde throughout the lengths. While this color variance may not go with a slicked comb over style, it's the perfect accompaniment to this fun, tousled style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/color-contrast-quiff-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-quiff-haircuts-for-men/;Comb Over Quiff;Actor Douglas Booth sports a combed over quiff that's one of the most sophisticated ways to wear the style.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Classic Pompadour;This classic pompadour haircut features hair that tapers in length from front to back, creating a slanted silhouette when styled into place.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Relaxed Pompadour;In this relaxed pompadour, hair is styled up high but looks more tousled than rigidly sculpted into place.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Greaser Pompadour;Straight out of the '50s, this is a full on throwback look that can be challenging to style with a modern wardrobe.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Hard Part Pompadour Fade;This pompadour fade has a dramatic shape thanks to a hard part that's shaved into one side.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Swooped Pompadour;Instead of styling hair straight up and back, this pompadour incorporates a fun swoop into its style.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Pompadour With Low Skin Fade;Not your typical fade, the lower half of this haircut adds tons of visual interest to the style.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Swept Pompadour;With hair that looks bouncy and soft to the touch swept dramatically upwards away from the face, this pompadour is an impressive styling feat.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Undercut Pompadour;Unlike a pompadour fade where hair at the back and sides are tapered down to a shorter length, this undercut style features a very short uniform length all the way around.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Thick Pompadour With Skin Fade;Thick hair provides tons of material to work with when styling a pompadour, and is nicely combined with faded sides to make styling take less time. If you have trouble getting your thick hair to stay in place, ask your barber to add some texture to help remove some bulk from your hair while keeping the same overall shape.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Thick-Pompadour-With-Skin-Fade-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;High Fade Pompadour;Putting up a big wall of hair, this high pompadour is an attention grabbing style that will help your face look longer and more slim, especially when combined with a skin fade at the sides.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/high-fade-pompadour-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Slicked Back With Low Fade;This pompadour is more casually styled, making it an easier look to maintain on a day-to-day basis. The low fade keeps things looking clean around the ears and back of the neck without making a dramatic statement.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Low-Fade-slicked-back-pompadour-300x300.jpeg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Pompadour Comb Over Fade;This pompadour is combed over to one side, helping it to look more modern than a style that's harshly slicked back. A high and tight fade makes this a favorite pompadour haircut among young men, as closely cropped sides are still the most popular style for them to wear.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pompadour-comb-over-fade-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Short In The Back Pompadour;This pompadour style is a bit different, because the longer pieces of hair on top don't extend quite as far back. The resulting haircut is easier to style, because the back won't ever be a concern.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/short-front-pompadour-212x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Tapered Sides Pompadour;If you've been thinking about a pompadour haircut but are afraid of looking like you're wearing a vintage costume, this is the style for you. This pompadour cut has dramatic shape up top, while tapered sides help retain an air of stylish professionalism.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ivy-league-pompadour-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Messy Pompadour;Zac Efron is known for his many messy hairstyles, like this young, fresh spin on the classic pompadour.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Short Pompadour;This laid back haircut is one of the shortest pompadours on our list, and it tapers in length from front to back, meaning there isn't a large section of hair that needs to be styled into place.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/short-pompadour-255x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Parted Vintage Pompadour;This vintage look features a defined part, creating a pompadour that's combed over to one side, while hair on the other side is slicked downwards. Try this style out if you're having trouble training your hair to stay slicked straight back, or if you're looking for something a little softer than a more dramatic, pushed back style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/parted-vintage-pompadour-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Messy Pompadour;This hair is messily brushed back, giving it a pompadour silhouette without the sleek look of every hair being perfectly in place. The result is a wearable, everyday look that works especially well for men with wavy or curly hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/messy-pompadour-1-263x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-pompadour-haircuts-for-men/;Dramatic Pompadour With Undercut;This dramatic pompadour is a gravity defying work of art that will bring tons of attention your way.

http://hairstylehub.com/waterfall-braid-tutorial-how-to-do-a-waterfall-braid/;Two Strand Waterfall;To make a two strand waterfall braid, begin with only two strands of hair, twisting one section over the other. Pick up a section of hair from the top of the braid, but instead of adding it in, slip it through your two twisted pieces, and drop to create the waterfall. Continue on using this technique, never adding pieces into the braid, but simply weaving them through your two strand twist.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/two-strand-waterfall-300x200.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/waterfall-braid-tutorial-how-to-do-a-waterfall-braid/;Bridal Waterfall Braid;Perfect for any bride with long locks and a bohemian chic style, this look uses a waterfall braid and a regular three strand braid to create a halo effect.

http://hairstylehub.com/waterfall-braid-tutorial-how-to-do-a-waterfall-braid/;Thick Waterfall Braid;To make more of a statement with your waterfall braid, use thicker strands to create a pronounced waterfall, and curl hair in deep ringlets afterwards.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Thick-waterfall-braid-curled-hair-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/waterfall-braid-tutorial-how-to-do-a-waterfall-braid/;Angled Waterfall Braid;This waterfall features a more diagonal shape, continuing all the way down the neck instead of stopping in the middle of the back of the head.

http://hairstylehub.com/waterfall-braid-tutorial-how-to-do-a-waterfall-braid/;Waterfall Headband;To get this headband braid, create a waterfall braid beginning at each temple, and tie them together where they meet at the back of the head.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Double-Waterfall-Headband-230x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/waterfall-braid-tutorial-how-to-do-a-waterfall-braid/;Waterfall With Trailing Braid;Instead of finishing your waterfall at the back of the head and pinning it in place, this look continues braiding down the hair using a simple three-strand technique. Try this style if you're looking for a waterfall that will stay in place during busy days, or for anyone with finely textured hair that's difficult to keep in place using pins alone.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Waterfall-Trailing-braid-268x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/waterfall-braid-tutorial-how-to-do-a-waterfall-braid/;Waterfall Braid With Flower Bun;Create a waterfall braid ending either at the back of the head or off to the side, and tie off with an elastic.

http://hairstylehub.com/waterfall-braid-tutorial-how-to-do-a-waterfall-braid/;Waterfall Braid Bun;To get this waterfall style, you'll want to begin a braid near the top of the head, braiding down towards one ear as you go. Use the regular waterfall technique, but drop the section of hair towards where your bun will be, and keep these pieces secure with a clip as you go. Once the braid is finished, unclip the pieces of hair you dropped from the braid, and gather them up with the rest of your hair, tying it together in your favorite bun or ponytail.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/waterfall-braid-top-knot-267x300.png; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/waterfall-braid-tutorial-how-to-do-a-waterfall-braid/;Double Waterfall Braid;This double waterfall style looks impressive, but isn't much more complicated than a single style. Once you've got your first waterfall completed, begin a second braid right underneath where the first one began. Where you reach the step where you'd pick up hair to add to the braid, use the pieces that were dropped from the first braid. Drop pieces from the bottom of the second braid as you normally would, and the end result will be two connected waterfall braids.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/double-waterfall-braid-300x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/waterfall-braid-tutorial-how-to-do-a-waterfall-braid/;Ladder Braid;To get this modified style, begin by braiding one classic waterfall braid. Create your second braid underneath this braid, picking up the dropped sections from the first braid to add to the hair. Continue on in this method, but do not drop any sections from the bottom of your second braid. The end result is two connected braids with no waterfall sections falling from the second braid.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ladder-Braid-225x300.jpg; ;

Begin by dividing a section of hair on the left side of your head into four strands. Take the strand on the far right side and cross it underneath the strand next to it, then overtop of the strand next to that, and finally underneath the far left strand. Next take the middle two strands, and cross the left strand over the right strand. Pick up the far right strand, and cross it underneath the strand next to it, picking up some loose hair to add into it, then cross it over the top of the next strand, and underneath the far left strand. When you bring the far left strand over the top, pick up a section of hair and add it into this piece. The strand that is now on the far left will be the first waterfall strand. Cross the middle piece over the one on the left, and you're set to begin the cycle again, picking up a new piece of hair to replace the far left strand that was previously dropped.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/four-strand-waterfall-braid-300x200.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Classic Fade;With clean lines and simple, minimalistic styling, this classic fade cut looks good on everyone, and helps to slim the face and highlight cheek and jaw bones. Once your barber has done their work getting your fade just right, this is a low maintenance style that requires very little work until it's time to get your next trim.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/classic-fade-234x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Tapered Buzz Cut;This simple haircut has attention to detail in its tapering between the slight difference in length between hair on top and the sides. Keeping the sides of your buzz cut shorter than the top can help extend the length of time between trims before your hair starts looking shaggy or fuzzy around the ears.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/tapered-buzz-cut-209x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Slicked Hair With Undercut;One of the edgier ways to wear you hair, this cut contrasts longer pieces on top with closely undercut sides, and has become a trendy favorite among young men.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/slicked-hair-with-undercut-207x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Short Crew Cut;The crew cut is the standard when is comes to simple, classic hair. Suitable for men with hair of varying thickness and textures, this style keeps hair short, professional, and is easy to style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/short-crew-cut-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Short Buzz Cut;If you're one of the many men with a receding hairline or thinning hair, going for a buzz cut like the steely-eyed Jason Statham is a great way to embrace having shorter hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/short-buzz-228x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Short Mohawk;If you like the mohawk style but don't want to grow any of your hair long, try this short mohawk cut. With hair buzzed close at the sides and left only about an inch long on top, the contrasting lengths give you a mohawk look that's edgy yet easy to style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/short-mohawk-226x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Short Waves;Some men with wavy hair feel they need to keep it super short at all times, but we love the look of letting curls grow out enough to make their texture visible. With the use of the right products, these short tousled waves don't require much styling time, and will set you apart from the straight haired majority.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Short-waves-271x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Classic Caesar Cut;A short cut that features a longer fringe styled across the forehead, the classic caesar cut has a little more personality and flair than a crew or buzz cut. Because the caesar cut has enjoyed on and off popularity in various forms, we recommend styling it with a light touch (instead of aggressive combing and using tons of product) to make sure yours looks modern.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/classic-caesar-cut-261x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Mohawk Fade;Featuring the classic mohawk silhouette with a strip of longer hair running down the middle of the head, this style is framed by faded sides instead of sharply contrasting shaved sections. The resulting cut is stylish and somewhat edgy without looking counterculture.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mohawk-fade-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Square Cut;Left a little bit longer on top and with some framing around the face, this haircut creates a square silhouette that's clean and masculine. Because the sides are kept longer than a classic crew cut, you'll need to have your hair trimmed more frequently to stop it from looking sloppy around the ears.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Square-Cut-207x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Modern Ivy League;While the classic ivy league cut is basically a longer version of the crew cut, this modern version sees hair on top styled slightly upwards, making it more of a style consideration than a staple haircut.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ivy-League-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Textured Caesar;This caesar cut has lots of texture, making it a light style full of movement, and a great choice for men who are looking to make thicker hair more manageable.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/textured-caesar-300x272.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Spiked Faux Hawk;If you like the idea of a mohawk but don't want to go for the fully edgy look and styling upkeep, this faux hawk is the perfect short style for you. To get Zac Efron's softly spiked style, blow dry hair into place and then set with a styling cream or other product that provides gentle hold.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/spiked-faux-hawk-229x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Textured Ivy League;This variation on the ivy league style has been cut with lots of texture in the longer pieces, and further accentuated by the honey colored highlights placed throughout. Try this out if you're looking for a casual hairstyle that can easily take you professional meetings to outdoor adventure.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/textured-ivy-league-300x300.jpeg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Modern Crew;Similar to the classic crew cut in its overall shape, this modern version features a higher fade on the sides and longer hair on top. The resulting style is favored by younger men as a trendier way to wear short hair that's still appropriate in a professional setting.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Modern-Crew-224x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Drop Fade With Curls;The drop fade technique angles hair according to the curvature of the head, resulting in a fade that's lower at the back than the sides. We especially love a drop fade when it's combined with hair that's a little longer on top, but you can add it to any faded style if you're looking for a more natural look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/drop-fade-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Slight Taper Cut;Another style we recommend for men with thinning hair, Jude Law's signature style is cut close to the same length all around, with slight tapering at the back and sides to keep things looking clean around the ears.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Slightly-tapered-cut-194x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Short Natural Curls;Leaving hair a little longer than the classic fade cut gives natural curls some room to play while still remaining in a manageable shorter style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Short-Natural-Curls-231x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Tousled Quiff;If you want to get maximum volume and height out of a short haircut, try styling it in this modern, tousled quiff. Brush hair forwards from the crown of the head towards the hairline, then style pieces at the front in an upwards direction.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/tousled-quiff-201x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Parted Comb Over;Parted comb over styles feature a nice mix of vintage charm and modern style, making them a good choice for men of any age.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/parted-comb-over.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Natural Curls With Hard Part;The hard part is a favorite style element for guys who love trips to the barber and precise haircuts. For straight haired men, it defines a section of hair to be combed over, and for curly haired men it can be used to create sections of hair at different levels. In the pictured style, the shaved part helps create depth within natural curls, and compliments the crisp skin faded sides.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/natural-curls-with-hard-part-227x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Businessman;Worn in a combed over style and slightly tapered at the sides, this businessman's cut is a classic style that projects professionalism and confidence.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Businessman-230x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Modern Pompadour;The modern incarnation of the '50s sensation, this pompadour features much shorter sides that keep the haircut in line with current trends while helping to highlight longer hair on top. Even when worn in a messier more casual way, the pompadour still oozes style and turns heads.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/modern-pompadour-300x295.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Skin Fade Quiff;Undercuts and skin fades have become a staple of modern men's haircuts, meaning we're seeing them mixed with all sorts of different styles. This skin fade quiff is a more unusual choice that works well for men working in creative fields who have more freedom in their style choices.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/undercut-quiff-240x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Military Crew;This version of a short crew cut has more of a military feel thanks to its higher fade and relatively short hair on top of the head. Compared to the slightly longer hair we're used to seeing on Ryan Reynolds, this high shaved style comes across as more confident and mature.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/military-crew-240x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Softly Spiked Style;With hair softly spiked on top instead of carefully combed into place, this is an easy way to add versatility into styling your standard crew or ivy league cut.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/softly-spiked-style-250x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Uniform Length;Proving that not all short cuts need an undercut or fade, Bradley Cooper's short style here is a uniform length all around, creating a simple, clean shape that's just long enough to be slightly tousled on top.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/uniform-length-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Textured Crew Cut;This crew cut has been cut with lots of texture on top, making it adaptable to messier, piecey styling.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/textured-crew-201x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Edgy Undercut With Curls;This haircut fools you into thinking it's a simple taper cut, then breaks into a dramatic disconnected undercut in a one inch band around the sides. The style breaks from the traditional proportions of men's haircuts while still incorporating elements of trend, for an overall feeling of stylish rebellion.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/edgy-undercut-with-curls-246x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-short-haircuts-for-men/;Curved Part Fade;Being almost as well known for his style as his music, Drake's expertly faded hair with curved part detail has become a huge trendsetter, and looks best when paired with a short, well-groomed beard.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/curved-part-fade-300x290.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Low Key Comb Over;With hair softly combed over and a drop fade around the back and sides, this is a comb over style for guys who aren't into overly precise haircuts that require a ton of styling time.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/low-key-comb-over-fade-195x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Long On Top Soft Comb Over;Sometimes growing your hair out longer can actually make styling easier. This cut features hair that's fairly long on top, meaning it will stay put in a comb over style without needing a strong holding product. To provide a nice contrast, the back and sides are cut with a simple tapered fade.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/long-on-top-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Drop Fade With Hard Part;The drop fade style pictured here angles down towards the back of the head, following its natural curve rather than cutting a straight line around the sides and back. A drop fade can be combined with any comb over style, and makes a nice choice for men who want to conceal a pronounced curve in the back of their head, or want to minimize the amount of bare skin exposed after a fresh cut.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/drop-fade-with-hard-part-300x277.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Parted Vintage Cut;With its defined part, close cut sides, and contrasting beard, this haircut will have you looking like you just stepped out of a Prohibition era speakeasy. This cut is best complimented by carefully selected, well tailored clothes, and if you don't usually pay much attention to style and aesthetics, this probably isn't the style for you.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/parted-vintage-cut-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Sculpted Comb Over With Mid Fade;This shorter on top style with a mid skin fade is great for highlighting facial features like eyes and cheekbones. To get this precisely sculpted style, use a strong hold pomade that should stay in your hair all day while still allowing you to manipulate hair back into place if needed.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/swoop-with-mid-fade-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Parted Comb Over Fade;This haircut takes a modern approach to the rolled comb over styles made popular by '50s greaser culture. Hair is combed into place in a distinctive shape, but isn't as dramatic as its vintage predecessor.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/parted-comb-over-fade-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Military Style Comb Over;With a bit more hair on top than a classic military or crew cut, this is a great way to wear a comb over fade if you don't want to look too trendy. For men who work in very professional environments, this haircut is the perfect way to express some individuality while still looking work appropriate.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/military-style-comb-over-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Natural Curls Comb Over;In this style, hair with natural texture is given a defined hard part that helps accentuate the comb over shape.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/comb-over-with-natural-curls-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Dapper Sculpted Cut;With every hair perfectly in place, this dapper style has a sculpted part and is expertly combed up at the front and over to one side. The style features a bald fade where hair disappears completely into the skin for a suave look that grows out well and allows for longer time between trims.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dapper-sculpted-cut-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Hard Part And Lineup;Not only does this cut features a precisely shaved part, but the lineup around the hairline is expertly sculpted while also fading into the skin, making it the perfect example of the style possibilities when you find a highly skilled barber.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Comb-over-with-part-and-line-up-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Tight Comb Over;In another vintage inspired style, hair on top is long enough to be tightly combed into place, but not so long that it will trail down close to the ears on the side where it's been combed over.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tight-Comb-Over-247x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Long On Top With Grown Out Fade;When the hair on top of the head is kept longer, it's easier to wear the sides in a more grown out fade, as there's still enough contrast between the two to make for a deliberate looking style. With hair that's at least 6 inches on top, you also start to have the freedom to flip hair to one side without the use of too much product, making for a more laid back look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/long-on-top-with-grown-out-fade-240x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Curved Part Comb Over;The hard part in this cut is slightly curved, creating a shape that accentuates the comb over and gives more room to play with a defined lineup.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/curved-part-comb-over-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Comb Over With High Bald Fade;One of the edgiest looks on our list, this haircut has most of the back and sides shaved right down to the scalp, while hair on top is combed neatly into place. If you've been looking to sharpen up your style, this cut is a bold choice that's still appropriate for most workplaces.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/comb-over-with-high-bald-fade-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Pompadour Comb Over;Featuring a nice combination between a pompadour and a comb over, this haircut creates the perfect modern Elvis look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/pompadour-comb-over-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Low Fade With Sculpted Comb Over;For this look, you can see hair has been styled with a wider tooth comb, providing more varied texture throughout. The lower fade style helps to make this cut a little more unique than the ultra popular high fade styles, while still looking modern and on trend.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/low-fade-with-sculpted-comb-over-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Soft Comb Over;Featuring a fairly wide section of longer hair on top, this softly styled comb over is subtle, stylish, and timeless.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/soft-comb-over-257x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Sleek Comb Over With Hard Part;Expertly cut and styled, no hair is out of place in this sleek comb over. On the short side of this defined part, you can see a band of hair that's been left about an inch long before fading all the way down to the skin.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sleek-comb-over-with-hard-part-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Surfer Flip With Fade;In a nice combination style, hair is long enough on top to be flipped over the head, creating a side falling bang that looks surfer inspired. Unlike a surfer style though, the back and sides are cut in a fairly close fade, providing interesting contrast between the longer carefree style and a short, tight-laced one.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/surfer-flip--300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Casual Brush Back And Low Fade;This cut features a bit of a modified comb over, where hair is brushed back instead of over to one side. The finished look ends up being more casual and easier to style and maintain.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/casual-brush-back-with-low-fade-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Drop Skin Fade;The fade on this cut shows a stark contrast between the skin and longer hair that fades into it, while keeping hair longer and suavely styled on top.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Drop-Skin-Fade-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Tapered Comb Over With Soft Part;This simple, classic style is controlled without hair being too firmly slicked into position, and features a soft part that's not actually shaved into the hair, meaning you can play with its position. For a more casual look like this, we'd recommend you avoid using heavy products that will lock hair into one position, and instead opt for a lighter pomade or styling cream.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/tapered-comb-over-soft-part-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Modern Vintage Comb Over;Vintage meets modern in this slick style that's ideal for guys with super straight hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/modern-vintage-comb-over-fade-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Comb Over Fade With Curls;Because so many popular comb over styles feature hair that's precisely styled and slicked, it's more common among men with straight hair. With this look, hair is left long enough on top for natural curls to form which are then gently combed over. This haircut is a great choice for men who find long, curly hair too unruly, but don't want to wear their whole head in a shorter buzzed style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/curly-comb-over-fade-300x251.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Dapper Comb Over Fade;Perfectly polished without being too fancy or in-your-face, this comb over fade is a businessman's delight.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dapper-classic-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Comb Over Fade Design;Shaved designs can be incorporated into almost any faded cut, and they offer a nice contrast on the opposite side of a comb over style. It might be tempting to try this at home, but you should stick to a trusted barber to make sure your design looks slick instead of sloppy.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/comb-over-fade-design-300x204.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Comb Over Fade For Receding Hairline;If you've got a receding hairline, take careful consideration of how to wear a comb over fade. If hair is left too long on top, you'll look like you're trying to disguise your hairline. In this cut, hair is brushed to the side without being sharply styled into place, showing off the hair that's there without looking like you're overcompensating.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fade-for-receding-hairline-300x243.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Ultra Long Comb Over Fade;If you can't decide if you want a long or short haircut, this comb over fade gives you the best of both worlds.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ultra-long-comb-over-fade-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Comb Over With Mini Fade;Blink and you might miss this very subtle fade around the edges of Tom Hardy's classic comb over cut. We love this slightly unusual take on the style, and it's a great way for anyone to make this popular cut their own.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mini-fade-comb-voer-300x237.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/comb-over-fade-haircuts/;Heartthrob Comb Over;Another very classic take on the comb over style, Zayn's hair is gently combed over without creating much of a defined part.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/zayn-malik-comb-over-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/how-to-fishtail-braid-tutorial/;French Braided Fishtail;This style combines the fishtail braiding method with the french braiding technique of picking up hair and adding it to the braid as you go.

http://hairstylehub.com/27-blue-black-hair-tips-and-styles/;Tips For Blue Black Hair;The least damaging way to go blue black is for women with blonde or brunette hair who are looking to go for a darker shade like squid ink or navy blue. If you're looking to add brighter and more vibrant shades into the mix, be prepared to pre-lighten hair, especially if you're adding highlights over hair that you've just dyed black. Like with any unnatural color, fading happens, and we recommend you wash with cold water and sulfate free shampoo to prevent your new blue color from escaping down the drain. Blue tones are especially flattering against cool skin tones, and women with dark, cool skin can pull off the deepest blue black shades. If you've got a warmer tone, we recommend sticking to gem tones in blue and turquoise that will bring out warmth in brown eyes.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/blue-hair-300x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/10-bow-hairstyles-with-tutorials/;Simple High Bow;Tie hair in a high ponytail, but stop short of pulling all the way through, and leave at least a few inches of ends loose, pointing towards your forehead instead of the nape of your neck. Next, fan the folded portion of hair so that it divides into two equal portions. Grab the loose end of your ponytail, and fold back in between the parted sections of hair that are looped into the ponytail. Finally, secure with pins, and make slight adjustments to get your perfect bow shape.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/simple-high-bow-219x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/10-bow-hairstyles-with-tutorials/;Half Up Bow Style;This half up style is great for a more low key, casual day. Begin by tying hair from the ears up in a ponytail that sits at the back of the head, leaving some hair in a loop instead of pulling all the way through. Part this loop in half and use the loose portion of the ponytail to wrap around and in between, then pin into place. At this point you'll have a rather limp looking bow, and you'll need to pin each end of the bow to the back of your head to really bring the style together.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/half-up-bow-style-179x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/10-bow-hairstyles-with-tutorials/;Big Ponytail Bow;For this big bow style, start by creating a ponytail at the back of your head, then use a piece of hair to wrap around and conceal the elastic. Next, pick up about one quarter of the ponytail, and use an elastic to tie it into a loop. Use a similar sized piece to create a second loop next to it, and pin each loop down against the head. Take a thin piece from the remaining loose section of the ponytail, and wrap it between the two loops, securing with pins.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/big-ponytail-bow-68x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/10-bow-hairstyles-with-tutorials/;Messy High Bow;This messy bow style looks especially great on long, thick hair. Tie hair fairly high on the head, securing into a large folded bun that leaves only a few inches of hair loose at the top of the head. Divide your folded bun in half, and use the loose piece to complete the bow.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/messy-high-bow-90x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/10-bow-hairstyles-with-tutorials/;French Braided Back Bow;For french braid enthusiasts who are crazy about bows, this style puts the two together. Begin by creating a french braid from the nape of the neck towards a crown. This part can be difficult, and will take some practice to be able to do on your own. Once you or a friend have finished the braid, secure all hair in a ponytail, without pulling all the way through. Part the looped portion of hair in half, and use a section of loose hair to wrap in between, defining the bow. Use the remaining loose hair to wrap around the base of the bow for added definition, and pin into place as needed.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/french-braided-back-bow-134x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/10-bow-hairstyles-with-tutorials/;Lady Gaga Bow Style;This look is inspired by Gaga's iconic hair bow, but is more of an updo than the singer's “Poker Face” era style. Like most bow styles, it's formed from a folded bun that gets parted in half, then wrapped and secured with the remaining loose hair. By leaving some loose bangs in the front, this bow style comes across as a bit softer and more casual.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lady-gaga-hair-bow-170x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/10-bow-hairstyles-with-tutorials/;Side Leaning Top Bow;This style puts a little twist on the classic bow hairstyle by setting the originating ponytail off to the side. Create a fairly small loop in your pony so that the sides of your bow don't flop over, and wrap the long end of your ponytail around to complete your bow.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/side-leaning-top-bow-115x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/10-bow-hairstyles-with-tutorials/;Perfect Present Half Up Bow;We love how this half up bow style leaves a long piece trailing to look like the ends of a festive ribbon! Begin by parting hair from the ears up, and tying into a ponytail, but stop with hair only a few inches pulled through. Unlike most bow styles, you'll want to leave a longer piece trailing loose at the end. Fan apart and divide the looped portion of hair in half, pinning each side down to the back of the head. Finally, wrap the longer piece around the middle, letting the ends fall loose underneath your bow.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/perfect-present-half-up-bow-259x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/10-bow-hairstyles-with-tutorials/;Bun With Side Bow;Instead of using all of your hair to make the bow, this style ends up looking like a bun with a neat little hair bow holding it in place. Start by tying hair in a high ponytail, then create a loop with the top section, and fan it out to create your bun. Use remaining loose hair to create a second loop, leaving some hair loose at the ends as well. This second loop will be used to create your bow: fan apart and divide the loop in half, then use the remaining loose piece of hair to wrap between, and pin everything in place. You may need to experiment with different sizes of ponytails in this style to find what works best for your specific hair length!;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bun-with-side-bow-99x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/10-bow-hairstyles-with-tutorials/;Bow Braids Style;The most complicated style on our list, you'll need to start this one out by creating a diagonal french braid on one side of the head, securing with pins or an elastic for extra hold. To begin creating bows, take a section of loose hair from the other side of your head, and create a loop, securing with the closed end of a bobby pin. Use the pin to pull this loop of hair underneath the braid, while using your other hand to keep one loop on the side you started on. Continue this method to loop as many bows as you'd like through your french braid, and keep in mind that a tighter french braid will do a better job at keeping bows securely in place.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bow-braids-style-130x300.png; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Ringlet Pigtails;These sweet ringlets tied with ribbon are an easy way to dress up the classic pigtail style.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Folded Double Buns;Girls' hair can be hard to keep in bun styles, especially if it's too short to wrap or too finely textured to be held with pins.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Braided Bang;If you're just looking to keep hair out from falling in the face, this simple braided bang is your new style go-to. For little girls with finely textured hair, braids hold much better than clips and pins.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/braided-bang-277x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Double Braided Buns;This style hits the perfect note of looking fancy and complicated, but actually being very easy to put together. Simply tie hair in pigtails, and braid each one in a three-strand braid, securing with elastic. Wrap each braid into a bun shape, and secure with pins or by wrapping another elastic around the bun. Try it for dance recitals, school concerts, or other special occasions.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/double-braided-buns-203x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Braided Headband;Create a cute braided headband for long haired girls by creating a simple braid behind one ear, then wrapping it around the head and pinning to the other side. If you want to get more complicated, make it a five strand or fishtail braid.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Braid-headband-201x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Fishtail Pigtail Style;Fishtail braiding may seem intimidating to some parents, but once you've learned to do it it becomes second nature, and adds an extra element to your hairstyling. Separate each pigtail into two sections of hair, and create your fishtail braid by crossing hair from the outside of one section to the other. Alternate sides and repeat until you run out of hair! Messiness is part of a fishtail braid's charm and character, meaning you don't need to worry about getting every hair perfectly in place.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fishtail-Pigtals-206x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Textured Ends Bob;This bob style has textured ends and strategic layers that help it look like a fashion-forward grown up style, while making it easy to style and manage.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Ringlet Curls;This blast-from-the-past style is a great way to dress up hair on a special occasion.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Pull Through Ponytail;This style looks intricate but is surprisingly easy to pull off. Start by tying the front section of hair in a ponytail, and then gather the section behind it into a pony as well. Before you tie the second section with an elastic, gather the first ponytail with it, and secure them together. Repeat as far down the head as you'd like, before tying hair in the final pony.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/pull-through-ponytail-238x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Pixie Style;For girls who aren't into long styles, this cute pixie is easy to style and shows off a unique personality.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;French Braid Pigtails;Although french braided styles can be worn at any age, there's something extra sweet about a little girl with french braids.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Fancy Headband Style;For girls who hate having their hair put up, a fancy headband is one of the simplest ways to dress up a down-do, while keeping long pieces out of the face.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fancy-headband-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Half Up Dutch Braids;Dutch braids might look fancy, but they're just french braids where the hair is wrapped under instead of over.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Rope Braid Pigtails;Another fun spin on pigtails that only takes a few extra minutes to pull off, rope braids are created by dividing hair into two sections, and wrapping them around each other, then securing at the bottom with another elastic.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rope-braid-pigtails-197x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-cute-and-easy-easy-little-girl-hairstyles/;Cornrow Braided Ponytail;Fully braided styles like this can be time consuming to execute, but once they're in place you shouldn't have to worry about styling hair for the next several days. To keep braids looking neat and in place for as long as possible, have your girl sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase that doesn't cause as much friction against hair overnight.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/braided-ponytail-225x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-best-hairstyles-for-men/;Dapper Crew Cut;Anderson Cooper is almost as well known for his perfect silver hair as his journalism, which has a lot to do with the stylish crew cut he's usually sporting.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-best-hairstyles-for-men/;Classic Fade;With clean lines all around and an expertly executed fade, this style is a modern classic.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-best-hairstyles-for-men/;Square Cut;If you're looking for a clean-cut style that's a little longer than a crew cut, a square cut might be for you. Typically cut all one length but with some shaping to create straight lines around the hairline, you should freshen this style every six weeks to keep it from looking sloppy.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/square-cut-215x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/30-best-hairstyles-for-men/;Slicked Back With High Fade;Although this daring style may not be for everyone, it's great for men in creative professions who are looking for an edgy mix of modern and vintage elements.

http://hairstylehub.com/30-best-hairstyles-for-men/;Mid Length Layer Cut;If you've grown your hair out longer without getting regular trims, you probably found it looked messy and shapeless. Adding layers into mid length hair will give your style shape while eliminating extra bulk for men with thick hair. We love that Bradley Cooper's style here is long enough for hair to curl in the back, while still looking dapper and put together.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mid-length-layer-cut-300x200.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-best-hairstyles-for-men/;Classic Crew Cut;This more classic version of the crew cut is fairly short in front, and is styled with some product to create a a very professional, almost military feel. If you're noticing your hair is starting to thin, we'd recommend sticking with a shorter style like this one, as longer hair can end up looking stringy.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Styled-Crew-Cut-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/30-best-hairstyles-for-men/;Buzz Cut;For many men, this super short look is about avoiding having to style their hair, but it can also be a deliberate style choice if you'd like to look edgy but not overly alternative.

The cut is fairly blunt, but lots of texture in the ends keeps the shape from looking too harsh, while long centre parted bangs create soft lines around the face that are a breeze to style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sophisticated-Platinum-Bob-278x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/platinum-blonde-hair-color-shades-and-styles/;Ultra Platinum Lengths;For mermaid hair without the rainbow colors, this ultra long hair full of dreamy waves is the most luxurious way to look like you just rolled out of bed. To create these barely-there waves, wrap sections of hair around a curling iron, but keep it brief to prevent them from forming a well-defined curl pattern. You can also try twisting damp hair into buns and leaving overnight to set, but we wouldn't recommend trying this method for the first time on a morning when your hair needs to be perfect.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/glamorous-platinum-lengths-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/platinum-blonde-hair-color-shades-and-styles/;Platinum Balayage;The trendy balayage look doesn't seem to be going out of style anytime soon, and why would it?

http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Wavy Ombre Bob;This style features a nice contrast between straight roots in a darker colour and bouncy curls in a blonde ombre that begin at about eye level. If you're growing out a shorter bob, this is a great transitional style that doesn't need constant retouching in terms of cut or colour.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wavy-ombre-bob-276x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Jumbo Curly Bangs;A bob so curly, even the bangs are in on it! Far from an everyday look, these thick bangs have been curled under to create a texture that doesn't contrast dramatically with the rest of hair, while still managing to frame the face.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/jumbo-curls-with-bangs-177x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Curly French Bob;With or without bangs, the French bob is a classic short cut that gets lots of added body and bounce when combined with natural or heat styled curls.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/curly-french-bob-300x245.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Finger Wave Bob;The interesting styling here looks like a loose version of the vintage finger wave technique made popular in the 1920s and '30s, but this bob keeps things decidedly modern by using a lighter touch with product.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Finger-Wave-Bob-246x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Baby Bangs;If you're worried that curly hair above the shoulders might have you looking like your Grandma, these short, edgy bangs are a great way to modernize the style. For thick haired women, they also take some of the weight out of the rest of hair, making the curls easier to manage.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/short-bangs-curly-bob-300x276.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Undercut Bob;If you've got extra bulk weighing your hair down, this undercut is the trendy solution to all of your problems. Less hair equals less styling time, and you can sweep hair to one side or the other depending on how much of the shave you'd like to show off. In this dressy bob full of platinum curls, the unexpected undercut provides amazing contrast and adds tons of interest to your look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/undercut-bob-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Messy Long Bob;For thick natural curls, sometimes less is more when it comes to styling. Cut with little to no layering, this long bob lands just above the shoulders, creating a silhouette that's thicker at the bottom, and leaving some intentional frizz rather than going overboard with product.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Messy-Long-Bob-220x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Deva Cut;A game changer for women with natural curls, the Deva style cuts hair at a deliberate angle to avoid disrupting the curl pattern.

http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Piecey Bangs;For a curly bob that translates your personality as young and quirky, try adding these piecey, slightly curved bangs. With less styling time and face shape considerations than a fringe that's very blunt or short, these wearable bangs are the perfect accompaniment to your curly bob, or any other hairstyle.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/piecey-bangs-bob-257x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Wild Spiral Curls;Bringing back her famous curly style from the '80s, Kylie Minogue's bob full of wild curls is easiest to replicate if you've got naturally curly hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wild-curls-kylie-minogue-300x272.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Long Faux Bob;With longer pieces in front left loose, the rest of Kerry Washington's hair is tucked underneath to create a distinct, faux bob shape.

http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Layered Colour Waves;This warm honey colour is layered richly throughout the top layer of hair, leaving a darker brunette at the roots and underneath that make hair look endlessly thick and lush.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/layered-colour-waves-300x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Soft Lob;This softly curled long bob style is a timeless way to look chic and sophisticated. In a length that suits all hair types, some dimensional highlights warm up the colour without looking obtrusive or flashy.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/soft-lob-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Sultry Vintage Glam;Channelling perpetual sex symbol Sophia Loren, this chin length bob is full of big curls that ooze sultry glamour. Unlike longer styles that often signal the naivety of youth, this gives off a look of pure confidence that both attracts and intimidates.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/vintage-glam-bob-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Triangle Bob;While many curly-haired women go out of their way to avoid the triangle silhouette created when bob length hair is left all one length, it's making a comeback along with other vintage trends.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/triangle-bob-227x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/curly-bob-hairstyles/;Brushed Out Curls;A more squared-off example of the triangle shaped bob, Solange's natural curls have been gently brushed out to create bigger, softer waves that land at a long bob length. This is a go-to method for women with tight curls to add some diversity to the look and texture of their hair without straightening.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Brushed-out-bob-solange-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Smoky Grey Ombre;This long, naturally black hair turns to a smoky grey shade at the ends, making it silvery enough to be on-trend, but more subtle than a white shade that can be difficult to achieve and keep, especially on naturally dark hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/smokey-grey-ombre-270x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Blended Caramel Blonde;Using some darker caramel shades to help transition between black roots and blonde ends, this ombre style steers clear of harsh lines where one colour ends and another begins. This rich blend of dark and light is the perfect style choice for warming up your look during fall and winter months.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/blended-caramel-blonde-ombre-213x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Black Dip Dye Bob;Stepping out with a bold style that treats hair colour like an art project, Drew Barrymore's dip dye black ends are the perfect accompaniment to her blunt blonde bob. Not only is this look fairly easy to replicate on your own, but the small amount of black makes it easy to lose the ombre ends with a quick trim.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/black-dip-dye-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Black With High Silver Ombre;This silver ombre starts high up enough that most of the hair is a steely colour, and only a few inches of black root are exposed at the top. Although silver is a bold colour choice, it pairs well with almost any shade of lipstick or outfit.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/black-and-high-silver-ombre-214x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Black And Pink Ombre Blunt Cut;This ultra sleek blunt bob balances black roots and pink lengths, for a style that mixes superhero style with fashionista flair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Black-with-Pink-Blunt-Ombre-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Aqua On Black Curls;For natural curls with a little dose of mermaid colour, this ombre style adds an aqua shade that's concentrated on hair's top layer.

http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Natural Brunette With Black Ends;Unlike the typical colour palette that sees blonde ends on natural brunette hair, this hairstyle features black ends for a dark and stormy look that you won't see everyone else wearing.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/natural-brunette-with-black-ombre-300x200.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Black And Purple Balayage;These long, gorgeous raven locks get a subtle colour bump with rich amethyst and blended smoky purple shades.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Smoky-Purple-Balayage-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Black And White Ombre;Creating the starkest possible contrast, this hairstyle is half jet black and half silvery white.

http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Black With Peachy Pink Ombre;This pastel ombre on natural black hair is a great example of how vibrant temporary colours can look stylish even as they wash and fade out of hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/black-with-peachy-pink-ombre-266x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Black And Aqua Pixie;Although pixie cuts don't usually get in on the ombre action, this short black cut has light aqua bangs that prove mermaid style isn't only for women with long hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/black-and-aqua-pixie-300x298.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Black With Blonde Ends;Bleached blonde ends on long black hair make for an edgy style that's far from subtle. Because the chemical lightening process opens hair's cuticle, it can make strands feel thicker, but also dried out and potentially damaged.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/black-with-blonde-ends-203x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/black-ombre-hair/;Electric Green On Black;While vibrant shades have been a popular trend for the last few years, true green is a shade that's been mostly left alone. Leave it to Katy Perry, queen of bold hair colours, to wear it flawlessly. Not only does this shade bring out her steely eyes, but it pairs perfectly with black roots to create a bold but earthy palette.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Electric-green-ombre-300x225.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Long Waves With Blunt Bangs;For women with longer faces who are in love with mermaid locks, wearing hair with some texture is the best way to prevent your face from being elongated. Blunt bangs that hit just below the brow are the perfect addition to this look, because they conceal the forehead, therefore shortening the face and emphasizing the eyes.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Long-Waves-With-Blunt-Bangs-193x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Face Framing Bangs;By covering part of the forehead and adding volume at the sides of the face, these long, centre-parted bangs help flatter long face shapes even when hair is tied back in a ponytail.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Face-framing-bangs-210x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Long Hair With Thick Texturized Bangs;This long style keeps hair relatively flat at the crown of the head to avoid adding length to the face, but uses waves to create volume throughout the rest of the hair. If blunt bangs are too much work for you, try these texturized bangs that land below brow level, shortening the face and creating a rounded silhouette thanks to gradual lengthening at the sides.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/long-hair-with-thick-texturized-bangs-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Curly Bob With Deep Side Part;This chic bob is styled with curls that begin several inches below the roots, adding volume and bounce without making your face appear longer. These side swept bangs are slightly shorter than what's usually recommended for women with longer faces, but the deep side part keeps them flattering.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/curly-bob-with-side-swept-bangs-218x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Medium Cut With Flicked Layers;Layers generally help to widen the appearance of the face, and the outward flick seen styled here adds an extra visual cue to draw the eye in a horizontal direction.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Mid-Length-With-Flicked-Layers-221x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Medium Cut With Big Waves;By cutting some long layers into thick, medium length hair, your naturally long face will look fuller at the cheeks. Subtle face framing highlights help add to the effect, and are a better choice than ombre colour that draws the eye downwards.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Medium-Cut-With-Big-Waves-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Long Bang Pixie;Hair that's cut shorter than bob length can be difficult when flattering long faces, as it's harder to create the illusion of width at cheek level. If you're set on trying a pixie cut, we'd recommend going for this sophisticated style that has enough length in the front pieces to sweep over the forehead, and avoid styling hair so that's slicked down at the sides.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Long-Bang-Pixie-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Medium Almost-Blunt Cut;Kept at a fairly uniform length all around, some texturizing at the ends and a side swept bang give this haircut a round shape that creates the same illusion in the face.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/medium-blunt-cut-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Long Glamour Curls;If you've got a long face, and you want to wear your hair long with no bangs, face framing curls are a must. Sarah Jessica Parker styles her long hair with volumizing curls that begin around cheek level, instantly widening her face, while highlights add an extra pop.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/long-curls-215x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Bouncy Layers;Leave it to a southern girl like Carrie Underwood to wear collarbone length hair like she's the belle of the ball. These bouncy layers are both glamorous and fun, and this is one of the best bang-free ways to balance out an oblong face.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Glamour-Layers-224x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Long Bob With Waves;For women with thick hair and a longer face shape, this wavy style with a deep side part makes a very flattering and surprisingly low maintenance choice.

http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Long Bang Bob;For a more casual and easier to style haircut than the chin length bob, try this slightly longer style. The long bang in front helps to draw the eye to the cheeks, but doesn't need to be blowdried and flat ironed every morning.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/long-bang-bob-214x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Wavy Lob;The lob haircut with long layers that everyone's after isn't off limits if you have an oblong face, just aim to add curls and waves rather than styling hair flat.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wavy-lob-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Lob With Deep Side Part;If you feel less interested in adding curls and waves to your lob, or your curls are in a flatter next-day style, move your part to one side to create the instant illusion of wider cheeks.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/deep-side-part-lob-200x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/hairstyles-for-long-faces/;Triangle Bob;A blunt, chin length cut that's worn in curls tends to create a triangle shape that some women avoid. As long as you aren't trying to minimize a square jaw, this triangle frame will help to reshape your face, and is gaining popularity as a retro-inspired trend.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/triangle-bob-1-227x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Platinum blonde fringe cut;This is snow white platinum blonde fringe cut. This cut has a choppy bang and long layers.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Modern mullet with undercut;Who knew mullets could be so chic? Everything about this style is absolutely amazing.

The undercut really kicks this look up a notch to make it a definite head turner.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/77-209x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Angled bob with purple highlight;Tired of the boring brown and blonde highlights? Try layering these purple highlights over chestnut brown hair. Brown is a very neutral base opposed to black which makes the color pop even more. If your head is more of an oval shape then this angled cut will frame it perfectly.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/97.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Tapered high cut;Here is the feminine version of the typical masculine fade cut. The cut is perfect for women with heart-shaped faces. The middle section is rolled and tucked with the ends loose creating a messy look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/139-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Simple blonde locks;Sometimes going simple is best. Take these simple blonde locks for example just a little curl to the end. This look goes from a dark root to a platinum blonde into a yellow blonde. These colors mesh together very well creating a light ombre effect.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/231-221x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Tousled neck length cut Easy hair styles;Here we have a neck length cut with barely there curls. This adds a little bit of texture so that the hair is not flat. The waves and bangs give the illusion of thicker fuller hair. You can also tease the crown for added volume.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/322-218x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Brunette wavy bob;Here we have a blunt cut shoulder length bob.

This style is very relaxed but with the right dress and heels can be totally red carpet ready.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/323-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Half cut;This style is a bit different and has a boy cut on one side and long on the other side. We are used to seeing the fully shaved side but the fact that it's not fully shaved makes it more original. This is a great length because you still able to do a full ponytail or full bun. We love how well the bang transition from short to long is in a swept motion.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/413-221x300.jpg; ;

Try this look with your favorite combination of colors.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/69-300x200.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Ash blonde tapered cut;Nothing looks better on pale skin than an ash blonde color. This is a tapered cut with a section left out to act as whatever you want. You can wear it as a bang or you can curl it, braid it, or experiment with a new pop of color every week. This is perfect for women with more heart-shaped faces.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/78.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Spiked boy cut with dark roots;Spikes can be chic and flattering so add a pop to your boring boy cut with spikes.

http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Grey Ombre bob;It is no secret that grey is definitely in and we don't believe it's going anywhere anytime soon. We totally adore this grey bob. It has dark black roots and hints of brown that give off a purple hue when put against the grey. You can get these soft curls by using sponge rollers because they have a weaker hold. Can we talk about this amazing makeup? We love the purple lip which looks like MAC's heroine and the copper eyes.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/140-300x297.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Soft pastels Scene Hairstyles;Emo does not always mean black. Many people who consider themselves emo wear pastel colors. One of the most popular choices is a pastel lilac color. We love how this scene hairstyle and color looks against a paler skin with a touch of bronze or pink. This color really brings out blue/grey eyes and makes an overall softer look. We also love how the intense eyeliner gives that “emo” look by adding a sexy touch of darkness to the look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/142-216x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/20-emo-hairstyles-for-girls/;Cotton candy scene hairstyle;We love the mix of hot pink, baby pink, orange and yellow tones.

Despite the crazy colors, this scene hairstyle can actually be worn with a very versatile wardrobe, then give this color and cut a try!;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/232-199x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Long Warm Walnut Hair;This long hair in a brilliant walnut brunette is the perfect warm shade for any time of year. Styled sleek and with long layers, it's a great choice for fuller cheeked women looking to lengthen the appearance of their face.

http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Straight Boy Cut;Keira Knightley's short hair here is worn in a fairly boy-inspired style that sweeps long straight pieces across the forehead. Try this cut if you're trying to camouflage a larger forehead or balance out a heart shaped face.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Straight-Boy-Cut-214x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Silky Dirty Blonde Locks;In layered shades of dirty blonde, Cara Delevingne's long silky locks bring a new level of edge and sophistication to blonde hair. With hair this long, styling it straight can be time consuming, and we'd recommend using dry shampoo to extend your style and add days between washes.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/long-striaght-dirty-blonde-226x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Platinum Pulled Back Bob;If  you're looking to dress up your straight bob style but you don't have time for curls or a complicated updo, simply pinning back the top section will open up your face and add instant sophistication and maturity.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/platinum-pulled-back-bob-240x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Straight Blunt Bob;In one of the best hair makeovers in recent memory, Khloe Kardashian's blunt blonde bob uses the perfect combination of cut and colour to enhance her features. We often see Khloe's hair in a soft wave, making this stick-straight styling look even more perfectly polished.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/straight-blunt-bob-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Modified Bowl Cut;This modern version of a bowl cut or pageboy style does away with its predecessor's harsh lines, but keeps the silhouette of straight hair falling from the crown of the head without a defined part. If your hair is naturally straight and fine, this cut styles itself, but hair with a wavy texture will take some work to smooth into place every morning.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Modified-Bowl-Cut-203x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Blunt Bangs;Carly Rae Jepsen likes to change up her hair fairly frequently, but we almost always see her sporting a bold bang. This thick fringe cuts straight across her face, creating a dramatic look that's especially flattering on women with oblong faces.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/blunt-bangs-long-hair-205x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Asymmetrical Lob;While this style is almost too long to be called a lob, it's straight styling creates the undeniable bob silhouette in a longer version. The asymmetry in this cut could almost go unnoticed, making it a nice little detail you can play up or conceal depending on the day.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Asymmetrical-Lob-1-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Straight Half Updo;Long, straight hair can sometimes hang flat against the face, leading to an unintentionally tired appearance. Pulling front sections back and pinning them behind the head is an incredibly easy way to show off your face without any major style effort, and is a must for showing off statement earrings or a high-necked dress.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/half-updo-199x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Long Pixie;This long pixie cut with eye-grazing bangs is one of the best examples of how feminine a short style can be. Not only does it help emphasize the eyes, but beautiful bone structure in the cheeks and jaw are highlighted rather than hidden.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/long-pixie-198x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Centre Parted Lob;Jennifer Aniston's centre parted lob is never looking better than with straight styling that perfectly frames her face. If you've got a round or square shaped face, these long bangs help slim the face by minimizing a pronounced jawline or cheeks.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/centre-parted-lob-213x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Gwenyth Paltrow's Rapunzel Hair;With ultra long hair in a buttery blonde shade, Gwenyth Paltrow's signature minimalist styling keeps the focus on her face and gown. To keep hair this long looking its best, we recommend investing in smoothing treatments that help hair look incredibly silky even without heat styling.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Gwenyth-paltrow-long-straight-hair-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Parted Short Style;Leave it to androgynous beauty Ruby Rose to make a short cut look edgy and feminine all at once. This style is a great option for anyone growing out a shorter pixie, or women with medium length hair looking to test out a shorter look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/parted-short-style-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Twisted Headband;If you want to give your long, straight hair a quick update from daytime to evening, this twisted bang headband takes only minutes to pull off, and is easy to touch up as needed. To help keep hair in place, apply a tiny amount of pomade to fingers before twisting bangs into place.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/twisted-headband-211x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Straight Bob And Bangs;If you're getting bored of your long, straight hair, chopping it to a bob with bangs can make a dramatic difference in your look without putting too much strain on your overall styling ritual. While the bangs do need a little extra attention, hair that's naturally straight makes sporting a fringe less hassle.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/straight-bob-and-bangs-232x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;High Glamour Half Up Style;When a pinned back bang won't quite do the trick, try this half up style with major red carpet appeal. Best attempted on long, straight hair without any shorter layers, teasing and texturizing spray can help you get a bump as high as Beyonce's (or you can cheat and use a Bumpit, we won't tell).;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/glamour-half-up-beyonce-176x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Jaw Line Bob;Whether you wear it pinned behind your ears or let hair fall across the sides of your face, this short cut will surprise you with its feminine versatility. Ask your stylist for texturized ends to keep hair at the nape of your neck from looking bulky.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/jaw-line-bob-235x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Multi Level Undercut;To add some edge and interest to your long hair, try this side undercut. The line details and varying lengths of hair make this bold style look artistic and crisp.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/side-undercut-long-hair-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Glamour Pixie;Rita Ora's platinum pixie is about as glamorous as short hair gets, especially when paired with dramatic smoky eyes and crystal embellished accessories.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/glamour-pixie-226x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Mid Length Cut With Centre Parted Bangs;In this sweet style, bangs are slightly parted at the centre, creating a softer look than when they fall straight across the eyes.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/medium-cut-centre-part-bangs-195x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Long Pastel Style;This style puts the “chic” in mermaid chic. We often see unnatural hair colours styled in waves or curls, which helps to accentuate multi-tonal hues or mask any flaws or gaps in the colouring. Kylie Jenner's pin straight locks in a pastel sea foam hue draw extra attention to the flawless and dreamy colour, offset only by a strip of intentionally darker roots.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/long-pastel-hair-246x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Side Shaved Pixie;For women with thick, straight hair, shaving the side of a pixie style has the double effect of looking edgy and trendy, and making the cut easier to style. Sweep hair to one side for a dramatic deep parted look, or push it all back for a new take on slicked back men's styles.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/side-shave-pixie-300x260.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Angled Lob;With increasing length from back to front, this angled cut keeps hair from looking bulky around the neck while creating a sleek silhouette.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/angled-lob-215x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Bob With Short Choppy Bangs;To add some raw edge to your straight, blunt bob, pair it with short and choppy bangs. This style leaves nothing to hide behind and makes your eyes look brighter, making it the perfect natural facelift.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/short-choppy-bangs-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Sky High Ponytail;Wearing her signature style, Ariana Grande makes the ultra high ponytail work with street style or at red carpet events. While she sometimes adds some curls to the mix, we love this look best when her long locks are styled straight.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/high-ponytail-206x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Medium Cut With Bangs;A sophisticated style that won't look out of place in any professional environment, this medium cut keeps it simple with long layers and brow length bangs that frame the face without looking harsh or edgy.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/medium-cut-with-bangs-254x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/straight-hairstyles/;Straight Ombre Bob;Ombre looks great with waves and curls, but don't be afraid to show off your new colour with a straight style, which will come across as a bolder choice.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/straight-ombre-bob-297x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Messy Pompadour;Channelling Elvis Presley and the iconic '50s pompadour, Zac's version retains some of the messy style he's known for. Anyone with a classic tapered haircut can get this look by using a pomade that's got firm hold but won't lock up like a gel.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/zac-efron-messy-pompadour-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Ivy League Comb Over;At the 2012 premiere of “The Lucky One”, Zac went for a dapper look with this comb over style. A vintage hairstyle that's had a recent resurgence in popularity, this ivy league comb over can take any man's look from “guy next door” to gallant.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ivy-league-comb-over-zac-efron-300x188.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Slicked Back;In keeping with his recent transformation into an ultra-buff lifeguard for the upcoming Baywatch film, Zac's hair has also been given a more mature overhaul. With closely cropped sides, this slicked back hairstyle puts even more emphasis on his strong cheekbones and chiseled jaw.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/slicked-back-zac-efron-216x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Blonde Undercut;Even amongst celebrities, we see men experimenting with hair colour far less often than women, making Zac's bold blonde style all the more noteworthy. Instead of going for an all-over blonde look, dark roots help balance the lighter colour with Zac's skin tone, while messy styling has him looking like a devilish character we'd still end up cheering for.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/blonde-undercut-zac-efron-300x169.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Mop Top Style;The Zac we first fell in love with was a teenager with a mop top style to rival Justin Bieber's. While this haircut's fifteen minutes of fame are definitely over, it's fun to remember that not so long ago every young guy was growing out his own swooped bang style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mop-top-zac-efron-186x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Messy Faux-Hawk;With a style so messy it looks almost accidental, Zac showed off his playful side by wearing his chestnut hair in a crested style for this red carpet event.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/messy-fauxhawk-zac-efron-218x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Red Carpet Swoop;Dressing up his mop-top style for a red carpet appearance, Zac's hair has more texture and grit than in his shiny, clean-cut promo photos.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/red-carpet-swoop-zac-efron-300x198.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Military Crew Cut;Playing an unbelievably dreamy soldier, “The Lucky One” saw Zac cutting his hair into the shortest style we've seen him in. Smashing any suggestions that his hair was central to his appeal, Zac earned both People's and Teen Choice Awards for the film.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/crew-cut-zac-efron-250x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Man Bun;Because even the hottest celebrities need some down time, Zac was spotted wearing his longer hair in a half up bun, one of the trendiest (and most practical) looks for men with medium to long hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-bun-zac-efron-240x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Messy Brush Up;Somewhere in between a pompadour and messy faux-hawk, this brushed up style takes a tapered haircut and adds lots of product to the bang area. The finished look lands somewhere between disheveled and sleek, for a style that's decidedly young.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/brushed-up-hair-zac-efron-300x225.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Piecey Shag;From his earlier, long-haired days, this red carpet appearance is full of deliberate styling that emphasizes the shaggy layers in Zac's haircut. Great for showing off the lighter coloured highlights, these layered bangs almost end up overshadowing his piercing blue eyes.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/piecey-shag-zac-efron-199x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Laid Back Style;In one of the most casual styles we've seen him wear, this relaxed haircut uses minimal product, allowing hair's natural texture to show through. Keeping hair shorter at the sides and back keeps things from looking messy, and making this look one of Zac's easiest styles to emulate.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/laid-back-style-efron-250x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Short and Simple;Slightly longer than the military style crew cut earlier on our list, this look is a popular approach for men who want a little more room to play with styling options, but draw the line at having to blow dry. Whether your hair is thick or fine, curly or straight, this short and simple cut is universally flattering.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/short-simple-hair-zac-efron-250x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Soft Spikes;In keeping with his talent of wearing hairstyles that never look doused in too much product, even Zac's version of a spiked style has hair looking soft and touchable. To get this combination of hold and texture on your own, stay away from gels and use a light tough with a water based pomade instead.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/soft-spikes-zac-efron-222x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Brushed Back;At the 2016 premiere of “Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates”, Zac wore his hair in a more subtle version of a slick-back. Hair is brushed back, but has more height and movement than the more product-heavy style we featured earlier on the list.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/brushed-back-zac-efron-230x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Dark and Brooding;Although we're used to seeing Zac's hair with at least some level of highlighting throughout, this darker style strips away the sun-kissed colours. Still in his signature, messy style, the monochrome colour adds instant edge and maturity to Zac's look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/dark-hair-zac-efron-211x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Short Faux-Hawk;This faux-hawk style is an easy way to change up the look of your short crew cut. Simply direct hair together in the middle using your favourite pomade or styling cream.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/short-faux-hawk-zac-efron-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Long And Messy With Side Part;This longer hairstyle looks more grown-up than Zac's earlier mop-top styles thanks to a deep side part that keeps bangs off of the forehead. Abandoning the ultra-trendy, swooped bang style of his High School Musical days, this is a great example of how to wear medium length hair in a classic, face-flattering style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Long-Messy-Side-Part-246x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Retro Style;Thanks to his turn in the film adaptation of  Broadway musical “Hairspray”, we got to see Zac wearing this iconic '50s hairstyle. While he may not have kept it up outside of his filming duties, it's proof that he looks like a leading man in any hair era. Unlike the more modern versions of slicked back styles, this one features a wet look that's been achieved with a gel or oil based pomade.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/retro-style-zac-efron-204x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/zac-efron-hairstyles/;Medium Layered Cut;A great transitional style for men going from short to long, this medium layered haircut goes nicely with Zac's scruffy facial hair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Medium-layered-cut-256x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Shaggy Bob With Bangs;Combining the ease and wearability of a bob with heavily textured cutting, this shag haircut is modern and incredibly flattering. Bangs are left long enough to graze the eyes, which should allow most women to get away with less styling effort.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/shaggy-bob-with-bangs-250x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Pixie Shag;Unlike the classic sleek pixie, this short cut is much choppier and messier, making it a good choice for women with coarse or naturally curly hair that won't stay in a smooth, sleek style. Tousled short cuts like this one also give extra room to play with dimensional colour, like Kiera Knightley's honey highlights.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Pixie-Shag-190x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Retro Shag;Most shag haircuts are at least a little reminiscent of the '70s, but this mid length shag with convertible bangs is the real vintage deal. Pair this cut with an edgy, well-tailored wardrobe to keep elements of modernity in your overall style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/retro-shag-224x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Posh Pixie;Victoria Beckham's hugely trend-setting pixie cut might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of shag styles, but its series of layers create a tousled effect everywhere except the bangs.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/posh-pixie-262x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Pixie With Nape Undercut;For those who only want a subtle dose of shag in their haircut, this pixie keeps hair long and straight in front, but features a series of layers in the back. The nape undercut is in keeping with modern trend while also preventing hair from looking mullet-like in the back.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pixie-with-nape-undercut-264x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Mid Length Cut With Thick Bangs;A thick-haired woman's dream come true, this style features heavy bangs that take a lot of hair to pull off, while the rest of hair is cut in three distinct layers that eliminate heaviness and bulk.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mid-length-shag-with-thick-bangs-219x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Shaggy Lob;While the lob still reigns supreme as the trendiest hairstyle, Julianne Hough's recent debut of this much more layered version might have shag styles poised to be next year's “it” cut. The perfect marriage between the modern lob and '90s super style “The Rachel”, this layered cut works for all seasons and hair types, although women with ultra fine hair may find it falls flat.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Shaggy-Lob-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Model Shag;For model Arizona Muse, this soft but shaggy, boy-inspired cut is the perfect compliment to her stunning cheekbones and intense blue eyes. To keep some feminine elements in your style, pair this hair with smoky eyes or red lips.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/model-shag-199x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Wavy Shag With Side Swept Bangs;Adding some wave to your hair can get you the shaggy look without cutting as many layers, making this a good technique to try out before you commit to further cutting. With messy tendrils throughout the rest of the hair, a shorter side swept bang adds a nice tame element and keeps the curls from taking over your face.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wavy-Shag-Side-Swept-Bangs-244x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Ultra Choppy Bob;Lisa Rinna is such a big fan of this shaggy bob look that she's worn the same style for close to twenty years! This retro-inspired style is a great option for middle aged women who are looking for a new haircut that's longer than a pixie but shorter than their current style.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/choppy-bob-shag-258x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Long Layered Shag;One of the longest shag haircuts on our list, this style is long enough to incorporate four distinct layers. Keep in mind that unlike a more traditional long style, the shorter layers make this less low maintenance when it comes to quick updo styles like ponytails and buns.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/long-layered-shag-240x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Super Shaggy Pixie;When reigning sitcom queen Kaley Cuoco cut her signature blonde locks, she shocked fans and inspired many to do the same. Keeping with her bright, bubbly persona both on and off screen, the pixie she opted for is fun, flirty and full of layers.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Super-Shaggy-Pixie-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Shoulder Length Shag;While Jennifer Lawrence seems to impress us in every role and look she takes on, her slightly shaggy shoulder length hairstyle was a surprisingly mature with a modern twist. For a dressy event, curling hair away from the face keeps a layered style like this from looking too helmet-like or distracting from features.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/shoulder-length-shag-221x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Sleek Shag Style;Although sleek and shaggy are often opposing terms when it comes to describing hairstyles, this is a brilliant example of doing both at once. This mid length style has three distinct layers that give it a shaggy appearance, but hair has been styled straight and with tons of shine. With a long, heavy bang that falls across the eyes, the overall look is young, edgy and bold.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sleek-shag-style-300x250.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Shag With Short Bangs;If you want a shag style that doesn't have a retro '70s feel, try this messy bob paired with very short bangs that bring the whole look in an edgy, gothic direction. Great for women with thicker hair, be prepared for the extra commitment of super short bangs, both in their need for daily styling and how much attention they bring to your eyes.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Shag-With-Short-Bangs-298x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Auburn Gypsy Cut;Another retro-inspired style, this mid length gypsy cut features centre parted bangs, a vintage trend that's regained popularity recently thanks to celebrities like Alexa Chung.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/gypsy-cut-226x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Wavy Shag With Long Bangs;With a heavy bang the same length as the shortest layer on top, this blonde cut creates a silhouette that can help balance out a square jaw.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/wavy-shag-long-bangs-227x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Ultra Choppy Bangs;The raw edge created by these extra choppy bangs is a bold look embraced by young fashionistas and trend-setters.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/shag-choppy-bangs-226x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Angled Shag Bob;This cut takes a classic angled bob and gives it a shaggy look thanks to hair left in its natural wavy texture and some added layering that's more subtle than most shag styles. The long bang draws eyes downward, and can help to balance out a larger forehead.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/angled-shag-bob-289x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Geometric Short Bang Shag;This cross between a shag and a graduated bowl cut features tiny bangs and roughly cut layers that get progressively longer towards the back.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/geometric-short-bang-shag-300x295.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Asymmetrical Bang Bob;These short bangs feature a slightly uneven edge that make them daring while remaining feminine. The rest of the bob has some texturing in the ends that make it slightly rough without the messy, gypsy quality of older shag cuts.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Asymmetrical-Bang-Shag-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Extreme Shag;This shoulder-grazing haircut is full of layers throughout, including in the bangs, giving it an extremely shaggy look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/extreme-shag-259x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Boy Cut Shag;Taking inspiration from a '60s era men's cut, this style can pair with laid-back trendy outfits (think boyfriend jeans and loafers) or more sophisticated styling featuring sheer, high-necked blouses and dark, statement lipstick.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/boy-cut-shag-237x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Shag Pixie Undercut;For women with the thickest hair, the most manageable way to wear a pixie is with an undercut back and sides that eliminate bulk and make styling easier. Longer hair on top is cut asymmetrical and with layers, making this style look its best when worn messy instead of sleek.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/shaggy-pixie-undercut-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Asymmetrical Shaggy Bob;With pronounced asymmetry between sides and tons of layers, this style has a lot going on. It's a great choice for women who value bold style over more simple, classic hair silhouettes.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/asymmetrical-shaggy-bob-254x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Shaggy Front Layer Cut;This long bob style has shaggy layers in front and rough texturing at the bangs, but layers get longer towards the back to create a hybrid style. Like other long bobs, you can wear this haircut in a half updo on days when you're short on styling time.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Shag-in-front-264x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Pixie Bob Shag;This shag version of the fun hybrid between a pixie and a bob has loads of choppy layers in the back and long, eye-grazing bangs in front.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Pixie-Bob-Shag.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Boho Shag;The subtle layers in this mid-length cut make it a bohemian dream that looks just as great with a flower crown and flowing dress as it does with a tailored skirt and blouse.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/boho-shag-199x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Textured Lob With Bangs;A super popular cut right now, this long bob uses textured ends rather than outright layers to create slightly roughened edges. You can sleek up this look by wearing it straight, making this a low-commitment way to get a little shaggy with your look.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/textured-lob-with-bangs-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/shag-haircuts/;Bob With Wispy Bangs;A big departure from Jessica Alba's usual hair both in terms of length and the darker brunette colour, this style is great inspiration for anyone who's looking to steer their look in a brand new direction.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/jessica-alba-shaggy-bob-225x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;Braided Mohawk Ponytail;One of the easiest styles on our list, this thick dutch braid down the centre of the head creates a mohawk silhouette that's fit for everyday wear.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Braided-Mohawk-Ponytail-206x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;Box Braids Mohawk;Complete with a shaved side for enhanced contrast, this style proves that box braids have tons of updo potential.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Box-Braids-Mohawk-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;High Glamour Mohawk Braid;This luxurious, intricate mohawk is made up of multiple different braid styles, and is perfect for a glamorous bride. The french braid on top uses tons of volume to create a high crest, while smaller braids at the sides are kept tight to the scalp, and long hair is finished over one shoulder in a fishtail braid.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Glamour-Mohawk-Braid-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;Pink Mohawk Updo;A braided mohawk that's surprisingly soft and romantic, this is a perfect updo style for a bride or bridesmaid. Best executed with medium length hair, the french braid running down the centre of the head should get a generous amount of texturizing spray to keep it from falling flat against the head. Once this french braid is complete, braid the hair down to the ends and tuck under, then use two three-strand braids from either side of the head to wrap around and hold the back in place.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pink-mohawk-updo-281x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;Box Braid Mohawk With Embellishment;The perfect mixture of edge and glam, this style frames the undercut style with pearls and gold.

Layer up as many as you'd like!;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Box-Braids-With-Embellishment-300x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;Fishtail Mohawk;With a big puff up front that leads into a long and messy fishtail braid, this look blends carefree boho details with special occasion flair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Fishtail-Mohawk-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;Janelle Monae Style;The signature hair silhouette of Janelle Monae, this particular mohawk features tiny braids at the sides, and a jumbo fishtail over one shoulder. While the singer is known for doing her own hair, it's OK if you need the help of a friend to get yours looking this good!;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Janelle-Monae-Mohawk-236x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;Multi Braids For Long Hair;If you're not sure how to get your very long hair into a braided mohawk style, try this look that features braids pinned towards the back of the head rather than directly on top.

http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;Mohawk For Short Hair;If your pixie cut has about five or more inches in length on top, you can make this french braided style work. Use a tacky product to keep sides slicked down and the ends of shorter hairs from popping out of the braid.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/short-hair-mohawk-braid-202x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;Mohawk With Ring Embellishment;With super teased hair on top and braided sides that resemble pierced ears, this edgy look is full of punky flair.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mohawk-with-ring-embellishment-234x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;Red Carpet Flair;Not a traditional mohawk or a classic red carpet updo, Nichol Richie's lilac hair is pulled back into a loose french braid that's both glamorous and ultra modern.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/red-carpet-updo-207x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;Curved Side Braids;This style makes natural curls the star of the show, while cornrows in a curved pattern add more interest than if hair was simply slicked back.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/curved-side-braids-mohawk-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/braided-mohawk-styles/;Undercut Mohawk;If you're running out of ways to dress up your edgy undercut, try slicking back your longer hair and framing with a french braid on each side.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/undercut-mohawk-300x296.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/asymmetrical-bob-styles/;Romantic Curled Bob;While asymmetrical bobs often lean towards the dramatic and edgy, this softly curled style is proof that they can also be a romantic choice. In this look, a subtle difference in length helps to accentuate long pieces swept across the forehead.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Romantic-Curled-Bob-193x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/asymmetrical-bob-styles/;Dramatic Sleek Bob;This dramatic, avant garde style is not for the faint of heart, but may be the major hair change you've been looking to make.

http://hairstylehub.com/asymmetrical-bob-styles/;Shaved Side Bob;While shaved sections of hair have been popular with women sporting very long or very short hairstyles, the trend is just starting to take off with bob and mid length cuts as well.

http://hairstylehub.com/asymmetrical-bob-styles/;Asymmetrical Pixie Bob;Half pixie and half bob, this style requires a fair amount of texturizing to keep it from looking helmet-like.

http://hairstylehub.com/asymmetrical-bob-styles/;Long Heavy Bang;If you love the face framing features of hairstyles with bangs but don't feel that a blunt or straight across fringe will work with your face shape, try this long bang that sweeps across the face from a deep side part.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Long-Heavy-Bang-Bob-197x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/asymmetrical-bob-styles/;Retro Bob;This red carpet look from Zoe Saldana mixes the retro feel of big waves with the modern trend towards asymmetrical cuts.

http://hairstylehub.com/bridesmaid-hairstyles/;;A top knot with something extra, this updo is as simple as putting hair in a high ponytail then braiding only the end of the pony before wrapping it around your hair elastic and securing it with pins.

Contrary to popular belief, white hair is not achieved by bleaching hair until it's white, but rather from bleaching hair to a pale yellow, and then using a purple toner to counteract the yellow shades of your bleached hair.

This slim braid adds a dash of extra interest to the hugely popular undercut hairstyle. Hair only needs to be a few inches long to style in a french braid like this, but you'll have more luck securing the braid if you dampen your hair and use a sticky product that keeps the ends of hairs from popping out of the braid. If you wear the top of your hair to one side, a single french braid at your part is a nice touch to dress up your hair, and if you like to slick your hair straight back you could try adding another braid on either side.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Undercut-With-French-Braid-300x300.jpg; ;

It's not! The whole point of growing longer hair is that it allows you to be more expressive, more versatile, and most importantly to have more fun. This style features five or six smaller french braids that are then collected in a top knot, also known as a “man bun”. In addition to looking great, braids like this are a practical way to keep long hair secured while running or playing sports, and will last much longer than a regular bun or ponytail.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/French-Braided-Bun-With-Undercut-300x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/braids-for-men-top-20-men-braids-ideas/;;This is a reverse french braid in more than one way. The braiding technique itself, which involves wrapping hair underneath your braid rather than over, creates a french braid that appears to pop out from the rest of the hair. It's also originating from the nape of the neck up, which is fairly unusual, but does an excellent job of drawing attention to this V-shaped undercut. This is one style where you'll almost certainly have to enlist help from a friendâ¦it'll take some serious braiding chops to pull this off on your own.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Reverse-French-Braid-Bun-300x300.jpg; ;

It sounds complicated, but using several small elastics to keep hair together takes some of the stress out of creating this style. Since rope braids are created by wrapping two strands of hair around one another, they're easier to get the hang of than a french braid.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Undercut-With-Rope-Braids-201x300.jpg; ;

Admittedly, fishtail braids are harder to execute than your basic three strand braid, but they can add lots of interesting texture to your hair, and look great either when tightly braided, or pulled out to look loose and messy.

http://hairstylehub.com/bob-haircuts-for-fine-hair/;;Thick bangs are usually not a great idea for fine hair, because they end up taking away a large portion of your hair's volume. These long side bangs are a nice way to frame the face without losing too much length or volume, and can balance out a top-heavy heart shaped face. Besides the bangs, this hairstyle is a relatively uniform length, and the cut uses an angle instead of layers to achieve movement and dimension. Hayden's golden blonde color and red lip help to round out a look that mixes modern style with old Hollywood glamour.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Sleek-Bob-With-Side-Bang-227x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/bob-haircuts-for-fine-hair/;;This artistic looking bob might seem high maintenance because of it's length and bluntness, but it's actually one of the easiest to style. This is a fairly flattering cut, but women with square shaped faces should go for a length below the chin, and women with round faces are usually better off with something longer or more sleek. Blunt bobs can make thick hair look heavy, but they have the opposite effect on fine hair. If you have naturally straight hair, investing in a smoothing treatment can make this look possible with no heat styling and minimal product. Isn't that what we all want in a hairstyle?;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blunt-Brunette-Bob-220x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/bob-haircuts-for-fine-hair/;;Adding layers can be a dangerous game depending on just how fine your hair is, but these soft layers kept mostly in the front add a romantic quality, and are a nice alternative to a blunt cut. A bit of a side bang adds extra attention to the face, but the hair is mostly long enough to be swept aside and tucked behind the ear. Because of the various textural elements in the cut, this hairstyle is a nice option for women with single tone hair color who aren't interested in using highlights or ombre to add dimension.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Soft-Layered-Bob-228x300.jpg; ;

This style has a few long layers, but is mostly of an even length with texturizing at the ends to create distinct tendrils. Color has dimension without looking unnatural, and darker roots make for the illusion of greater volume at the crown. We'd recommend this be the maximum length for anyone with ultra fine hair, as anything longer is likely to leave your hair looking stringy.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Straight-Long-Bob-235x300.jpg; ;

You can jazz it up the cut like in this photo. Layer some bangs in front and BANG! You're cute a fairy.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/6-1.jpg; ;

But if you do like to try it, keep hairspray or hair clay handy.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/8-201x300.jpg; ;

But for those stubborn kinky strands, you can tame those with a touch of texturizer.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/16-263x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/hipster-haircut-inspiration-top-15-hipster-hairstyles-for-men/;The Disconnected Pompadour;"The comb-over is no longer the hairdo of balding, middle-aged men. To achieve this deliciously hipster quiff, have your barber part your hair to the side and shave the sides of your head (including the 'shortest' side of your part). Then, style your hair sideways with a comb and some holding gel or pomade. Pair this look with neutral and dark colors in your wardrobe for the best effect; stretched ears and/or neck tattoos also pair well with this trendy quiff.";http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1-4-240x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hipster-haircut-inspiration-top-15-hipster-hairstyles-for-men/;The Comb-Over Quiff;Draw inspiration from the 'emo' days of My Chemical Romance and hip J-Pop groups with this edgy 'do. Have the sides of your head shaved or faded and then sweep your bangs over one eye for an effortlessly cool, mysterious vibe. This style is good for straight, wavy, or curly hair types so don't be afraid to experiment with this look no matter your hair's texture. This cut can easily adjust from “young professional” to “indie band enthusiast”. If you want a bit more 'daring' for your look, try bleaching or dyeing your locks a fun color and keep your face smooth.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/2-4-269x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/hipster-haircut-inspiration-top-15-hipster-hairstyles-for-men/;The Caesar Cut;Hipsters can truly appreciate how some looks just never go out of fashion: they are masters of reviving the vintage and the almost-forgotten. If a hot-off-the-runway, brand new style just isn't for you, ask your barber for a classic taper. The smooth top and gentle fade are timelessly cool and this classic look is perfect for the man who appreciates agelessness. Mantain your taper with pomade or gel. Pair your throwback 'do with a leather jacket, nice suit, and a clean shave for bonus effect.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/4-3-252x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hipster-haircut-inspiration-top-15-hipster-hairstyles-for-men/;The Classic Taper;A low fade only involves fading the very bottom of the sides and back of your hair. This look can be done with both long and short hair on top, given that you consult your barber to see which is best for you. It also works well with almost any (if not all) hair types. Again, a little bit of facial hair can really add extra 'oomph' when paired with this trendy style. This hairstyle is optimal for men who spend a lot of time outdoors or in the gym: the short tresses are easy to wash and style without much effort or product.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/5-2-195x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hipster-haircut-inspiration-top-15-hipster-hairstyles-for-men/;The Low Fade;Another finely aged style perfect for the modern hipster: the classic undercut. Keep your sides short and saved, but use pomade or gel to maintain a grip on your well-manicured top. Since your hair is so sleek, it's best for your face to stay clean-shaven with this cut. Cardigans and tweed pants are a go-to outfit when paired with a classic undercut. If your hair is wavy or curly, this style may not be the best choice for you but don't let that stop you: high-hold product can mitigate any conflicting texture.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/6-2-159x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hipster-haircut-inspiration-top-15-hipster-hairstyles-for-men/;The Classic Undercut;This 'do can be done with a variety of lengths and styles. Ask your barber to completely shave a small strip down your part, effectively creating definition. If you are having trouble keeping the rest of your hair in check, a dab of gel can keep your part defined. Additionally, this 'do is the perfect partner for a well-groomed, luscious beard. Think “trendy, city-slicker lumberjack”.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/7-1-201x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hipster-haircut-inspiration-top-15-hipster-hairstyles-for-men/;The Defined Side Part;Also known as the “Superman curl”, this style is achieved mainly through the use of product. Get your barber to keep you longer on top (especially in the bangs area) and use pomade to create a curl that falls over your forehead. To keep this 'do trendy and hipster, go for regular maintenance trims. Keep your wardrobe well-tailored to compliment the work you've put into creating the perfect curl.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/8-1-200x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hipster-haircut-inspiration-top-15-hipster-hairstyles-for-men/;The Cowlick Cut;Highlight your creativity (or quirkiness) by getting a design shaved into the sides or back of your fade. Bring a design to your barber or give him creative control of your new 'do. The more eccentric the design, the more hipster the cut. This look is especially beneficial for those who also have stretched ears or wicked facial hair they wish to draw attention to.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/9-260x300.png; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hipster-haircut-inspiration-top-15-hipster-hairstyles-for-men/;The Side (or Back) Designs;"An angled undercut is all about clean, sharp lines. While this 'do is relatively easy to achieve, it does take regular trips to the barber to keep your angles well-groomed. If you find yourself in need of an emergency touch-up, take a beard trimmer to untamed hairs. Since the top of your hair is so sharp, well-maintained stubble or even a beard makes a perfect pair; bonus points if you're a fan of chunky, oversize sweaters.";http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/10-1-300x280.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hipster-haircut-inspiration-top-15-hipster-hairstyles-for-men/;The Angled Undercut;Another throwback look, keep your fade clean while teasing the top of your hair into a bouffant. Achieve this style with a rat-tail comb and pomade/hairspray to hold your volume. Since you have a lot of volume on top, it's best to keep the rest of your look sharp: properly tailored and trendy garments pair perfectly with this 'do.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/11-1.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hipster-haircut-inspiration-top-15-hipster-hairstyles-for-men/;The Fade Bouffant;If you want to keep your length but have a clean cut, go for an undercut topknot. Get your sides shaved or faded and then pull the length of your hair into a topknot on the crown of your skull. If you're especially daring, dye your hair a funky color for even more fun. This hairstyle also pairs well with facial hair and/or piercings, glasses, and comfortable wardrobes (aka, slouchy sweaters and joggers).;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/12-1-254x300.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/hipster-haircut-inspiration-top-15-hipster-hairstyles-for-men/;The Undercut Topknot;Another hairdo that allows you to keep both your length and your convenience: the man braid. French braid your length and secure with an elastic and/or pin for this hipster style. Since the top of your hair is already a bit complicated, it is best to keep your sides short or shaved and your face clean-shaven. Experiment with different styles of braiding to keep your look fresh!;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/13-1-206x300.jpg; ;

If you have wavy or curly hair, this style is also wonderful for your texture. Keep your hair well-groomed with oil treatments and dry shampoo. This hairstyle is also perfect for ponytails, braids, and buns; experiment to find the perfect style for you. Additionally, facial hair pairs well with long tresses!";http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/14-1-193x300.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/updos-for-medium-hair/;Everyday Updo;Yes. Another continuing style called French Braid does well with medium length hairs.

But the payoff is worth it. This hair style will definitely live on.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/download-300x168.jpg; ;

http://hairstylehub.com/updos-for-medium-hair/;Side Braid; This style is so simple and classy. All you have to do is part a section of hair and separate it from the rest of your hair.

It is really fast and simple yet you will get compliments for sure.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/main.original.640x0c-300x232.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/updos-for-medium-hair/;Twisted Ponytail;Since we are working on an average length of hair, wearing your bun low would be the sensible choice.

Whichever way or side, this style is a staple.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/images.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/updos-for-medium-hair/;Low Bun;In creating this hairstyle, you usually need a tool that pulls your ponytail through resulting in an inverted or backward pony. But the simplest way is to just create a hole just above the crown of the ponytail and rolling the ponytail inside and pulling the ends all the way through. And viola! There is your loop-through hairstyle. In this photo it shows how it works well with slightly shorter medium length hair. Another style to keep in your catalogue.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/chloe-bbt-s11-001-200x300.jpg; ;

Just look at Jennifer Lawrence donning the messy bun in a red carpet event.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_8110-300x223.jpg; ; 
http://hairstylehub.com/updos-for-medium-hair/;Prom updos for medium hair: Messy Bun;This hairstyle goes well for the hot and cold season. Why? Well, if you feel cold, you can just pull the lower portion and it still gives you a half updo. While if you're strolling on a hot summer day, grab the rest of the hair and tie it together with the half updo in a low ponytail. In this photo, the model has 3 layers but you can use just 2: A half pony and a low ponytail. This goes well too with an edgy attire.;http://hairstylehub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Shoulder-Cut-Loose-Side-Bun-211x300.jpg; ;

With the curling wand, curl carelessly, alternating one-inch strands both towards and away from your face.
