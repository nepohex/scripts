However, if you're looking for those gorgeous Victoria's Secrets curls, blow-dry your hair and use plenty of volumizer. Refined curls that are super sleek and polished? Straighten hair using a straightener before you start curling.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/faaddb2fae82340b6b977f428d1f253a.jpg;faaddb2fae82340b6b977f428d1f253a
http://www.herinterest.com/easy-way-to-curl-hair/;How You Style Beforehand Influences Curls; For girls with fine or thin hair or hair that has been treated with color (especially bleach), never go above 200 degrees on your curling iron. No woman should need to go over 400 degrees, as this can damage hair and create a burnt, frizzy finish (and that's not attractive).;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/faaddb2fae82340b6b977f428d1f253a.jpg;faaddb2fae82340b6b977f428d1f253a
http://www.herinterest.com/easy-way-to-curl-hair/;Dont Over or Under Heat; Did you know you can switch up the look of your curls by the way you hold the curling iron? Yup, it's true. So if you want looser curls, make sure to hold the iron in a vertical position. Holding the iron in a horizontal position will produce tighter and bouncier curls.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2dee51e1ae9066936ff5f214b4b3f948.jpg;2dee51e1ae9066936ff5f214b4b3f948
http://www.herinterest.com/easy-way-to-curl-hair/;Control Curls by the Way You Hold the Curling Iron; Seriously, don't even try to start curling your hair if it's all hanging loose. Why? Because you'll probably end up with a really messy style, and aside from that, it will be a HUGE pain trying to reach the hair underneath. To make things easier and make your hair look absolutely flawless, divine up your mane with plenty of clips.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2dee51e1ae9066936ff5f214b4b3f948.jpg;2dee51e1ae9066936ff5f214b4b3f948
http://www.herinterest.com/easy-way-to-curl-hair/;Divide Up Your Mane; This is an especially handy tip for girls who struggle with holding a curl or for gals with super long hair. Clipping your hair up in a curled position right after you curl them is an easy way to ensure your curls will last through the night. Yes, I'm not going to lie, it's a bit of a pain- but trust me, it's worth it if you want sexy locks for hours on end. Make sure you have plenty of bobby pins present!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/b3fc77a42f6e757bc50ce3e6f42601b1.jpg;b3fc77a42f6e757bc50ce3e6f42601b1
http://www.herinterest.com/easy-way-to-curl-hair/;Clip Curls for Lasting Style; You can add tons of sexy volume to your curled locks by using a bit of simple technique (instead of drenching your mane in hairspray!). To achieve luscious look-at-me curls with tons of stunning volume, all you need to do is this: curl the strands around your face away from your face, and curl the next section in towards your face. Continuing doing this flip-flop routine until your whole head is curled.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/b3fc77a42f6e757bc50ce3e6f42601b1.jpg;b3fc77a42f6e757bc50ce3e6f42601b1
http://www.herinterest.com/easy-way-to-curl-hair/;Volumize Using Technique; Have you ever tried to curl wet or damp locks? You know that terrible 'sizzling' sound you hear when you do it? That's your hair telling you to stop what you're doing immediately. Not only is it SUPER bad for your hair, but you won't like the end result: frizzy, unkempt waves or curls that have undoubtedly lost their shape. Seriously, don't do it. Blow-dry or air-day first, but whatever you do, don't try to curl wet hair to save on time. It's not worth it.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3c1e8b627b3bc593b6e0bbccfc6b76b6.jpg;3c1e8b627b3bc593b6e0bbccfc6b76b6
http://www.herinterest.com/easy-way-to-curl-hair/;Dont Try to Curl Wet/Damp Locks; Please, ladies, if you haven't already, throw away your hairspray from the 1980's. Yes it has an EXTREME hold that will see you through the craziest nights, but your hair won't move. It won't have a luscious bounce. It won't look glamorous. It will look like an awkward sticky mess that doesn't move no matter how much you're dancing and jiving. Instead, use just a touch of hairspray with flexible hold. This will allow your curls to remain intact no matter what you're doing while still being full of life.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3c1e8b627b3bc593b6e0bbccfc6b76b6.jpg;3c1e8b627b3bc593b6e0bbccfc6b76b6

So why would you let your curling iron get grimy and gross? A curling iron with tons of product buildup won't work to its fullest potential, and it's your hair that will suffer! To avoid a dirty, gross curling iron that can hardly curl anymore, you need to clean it.

Ladies, when you have strong cheekbones, show them off by adopting a shorter cut that exposes your face.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Asymmetrical-bob_11.jpg;Asymmetrical bob_11
http://www.herinterest.com/asymmetrical-bob/;Michelle Williams Round Asymmetrical Bob;When Michelle William went for the pixie crop, everyone went nuts for the hairdo.

http://www.herinterest.com/asymmetrical-bob/;Clemence Poesy Centre Parting Asymmetrical Bob;When Mother Nature gives you delicate, angel-like face features, any hairstyle that you adopt will make you look amazing. We love the fact that Clemence didn't go for a perfect cut. The not-so-even centre of the bob gives the hairdo a fresh allure. The wavy ends add bounce to the hairstyle, and because this season is all about flexibility and ease, there's nothing we love more than healthy hair that moves.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Asymmetrical-bob_12.jpg;Asymmetrical bob_12
http://www.herinterest.com/asymmetrical-bob/;Emma Roberts Angular Cut Asymmetrical Bob;The angular cut of this hairstyle goes really well with Ema's soft features. The sweeping long fringe adds a special effect, and the uneven shape on the sizes gives it a modern allure many young women will love. This sort of hairdo is perfect for young women who want to look more mature, yet chic and modern. One of greatest advantage of an irregular hairstyle that's longer on one side and shorter on the other is that is gives women the chance to highlight the shape of their faces, as well as their best features, in this case the jaw line.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Asymmetrical-bob_12.jpg;Asymmetrical bob_12
http://www.herinterest.com/asymmetrical-bob/;Kelly Osborne Fringed Asymmetrical Bob;Hello there purple princess! Kelly Osborne has ditched the pixie for a purple bob. It makes her face look better than ever, especially because she also decided to adopt a fringe. When you have a full-round face and you want to hide overly-exposed cheeks, an asymmetrical bob that's shorter on the back and longer in the front is an excellent solution. Note that Kelly's fringe is above the eyebrows. This is important, and if you want your face to be seen make sure your fringe is properly trimmed.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Asymmetrical-bob_131.jpg;Asymmetrical bob_13

http://www.herinterest.com/asymmetrical-bob/;Lily Collins Choppy Asymmetrical Bob;Choppy bobs look fresh and rejuvenating. The hairstyle is perfect for the warm season, not to mention that it totally changes a woman's allure. Generally speaking, bobs make us feel sexier and more mysterious. That's probably because the hairdo reveals a woman's tempting neck area. In Lily's case, the choppy bob she's rocking emphasizes her eyes and lips. When you have face features that are so exquisite, you shouldn't hide them behind lots of hair.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Asymmetrical-bob_14.jpg;Asymmetrical bob_14
http://www.herinterest.com/asymmetrical-bob/;Camilla Belle Effortless Asymmetrical Bob;Oh she's belle indeed! Camilla's asymmetrical bob is wavy and effortless.

http://www.herinterest.com/asymmetrical-bob/;Cheryl Cole Curled Asymmetrical Bob;We never thought Cheryl Cole will ever quit her long, brunette wavy hair. And yet, she finally did it. The beautiful singer now has a medium-length bob that's lightly curled on the sides. As for the hair color, Cheryl has adopted a light brown hair dye that's almost dark blonde. It certainly makes her face features shine brighter than ever before.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Asymmetrical-bob_15.jpg;Asymmetrical bob_15
http://www.herinterest.com/how-to-cut-your-own-hair/;How To Cut Your Own Hair;Before you even think about cutting your own hair, it's a good idea to do as much research as you can. Reading this article is the first step! We recommend watching YouTube videos to see the different methods in action, reading step-by-step articles on trimming your own locks, and asking your hairdresser for tips. Once you feel confident and you've decided to give it a go, it's time to get ready.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/how_to_cut_your_own_hair_01.jpg;how_to_cut_your_own_hair_01
http://www.herinterest.com/how-to-cut-your-own-hair/;Do your research;It's easy to get excited about cutting your own hair and then attempting to do it immediately, but it's best to chat about it with your friends first. Ask for their advice, and perhaps ask them to be there when you try it for the first time. They can give you their opinions, and help out where needed. They may even have cut their own hair before, and have great tips for you! Organize a place and time to cut your hair so you can get everything ready well ahead of time.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/how_to_cut_your_own_hair_01.jpg;how_to_cut_your_own_hair_01
http://www.herinterest.com/how-to-cut-your-own-hair/;Get advice from friends;Whatever you do,   cut your hair with a normal pair of utility scissors, or the kitchen scissors. You will need a very sharp pair of professional hair cutting scissors if possible, or a pair of sharp fabric scissors. The sharper the better, as blunt scissors will damage your hair, causing breakage and split ends. You'll also need a long fine-toothed comb to keep your hair sleek and tangle-free.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/how_to_cut_your_own_hair_02-214x300.jpg;how_to_cut_your_own_hair_02
http://www.herinterest.com/how-to-cut-your-own-hair/;Get the correct tools;Although most hairdressers cut hair when it's wet, it's best to cut your own hair when it's totally straight and dry. Wet hair stretches, so it will dry significantly shorter than the length you have originally cut it to when wet. To avoid misjudging how much it shorter it will look, cut it when dry. Start with a thorough wash, with two rounds of shampoo and then a rich conditioner. After rinsing and blotting off excess water with a towel, blow dry your hair straight, or blow dry it and then straighten it with a flat iron. Comb it through very carefully to make sure there are absolutely no knots or tangles.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/how_to_cut_your_own_hair_02-214x300.jpg;how_to_cut_your_own_hair_02
http://www.herinterest.com/how-to-cut-your-own-hair/;Prep your hair for cutting;The key to cutting your own hair successfully is to take your time, and to start by trimming only an inch or half an inch at a time. If you have thin hair, you probably won't need to section it off much - maybe only two sections - before cutting it. With thick hair, it's recommended that you create many sections so you can cut through your hair easily. Pin unused sections of hair up or back with hair clips so you can focus on one section at a time. It's quite daunting when you snip that first tiny bit of hair off, but once you feel more comfortable with cutting your locks, it'll feel more natural.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/how_to_cut_your_own_hair_03-214x300.jpg;how_to_cut_your_own_hair_03
http://www.herinterest.com/how-to-cut-your-own-hair/;Practice one inch at a time;Start by stretching out a thin section of hair, combing it carefully, and then holding it tightly between two fingers when pulling down - kind of like a hair straightener! See the image above - she is gently pulling and holding the section of hair down while she cuts it. You won't be chopping off so much hair though, so only take about an inch or half an inch off, cutting straight across. Don't worry if it looks too blunt, as you will be softening up the tips in the next step.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/how_to_cut_your_own_hair_03-214x300.jpg;how_to_cut_your_own_hair_03
http://www.herinterest.com/how-to-cut-your-own-hair/;Cut sections straight across;You'll notice that cutting straight across at first will give you sharp, blunt ends. Remedy this with the second cutting technique of snipping upwards. Try to hold your scissors completely straight (vertically) and make tiny cuts to the straight lines of hair. This will soften the edges, making your hair look more natural and less choppy. Remember to do this to every section of hair you cut. You may want to leave your hair more blunt if you have fine hair, as it can make your hair look thicker and fuller.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/how_to_cut_your_own_hair_05-217x300.jpg;how_to_cut_your_own_hair_05
http://www.herinterest.com/how-to-cut-your-own-hair/;Cut straight up to even out ends;Your first attempt may take a long time! Comb each and every section of hair before cutting, holding the section taut while you do so. Check each section carefully after cutting, and touch it up if it's a bit wonky. That way, you will notice any problems before they mess up your entire look. And remember: you can always cut a bit more hair off, but you can't replace hair, so be very careful when chopping your locks. A mirror is essential, so you can check your progress every few minutes.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/how_to_cut_your_own_hair_05-217x300.jpg;how_to_cut_your_own_hair_05
http://www.herinterest.com/how-to-cut-your-own-hair/;Go slowly combing hair frequently;Hopefully, everything has gone to plan, and you're feeling confident and happy about what you've done. Fluff your hair out to remove excess hair, brush it well, and then take a good look at it in the mirror. Use a large mirror with good lighting, and a small hand mirror to see the back. If you notice any problem areas, simply go back and fix them. Your cut probably won't be 100% perfect or totally symmetrical, but it will look fabulous regardless of how exactly the lines match up.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/how_to_cut_your_own_hair_04-228x300.jpg;how_to_cut_your_own_hair_04

http://www.herinterest.com/10-best-winter-hair-colors/;Ombre;I think we are all aware of how incredibly ombre coloring has been lately. We've seen it on hair, nails, and even clothes! (Some people are even painting their rooms with ombre colors?! Why not?!). That being said, it's only obvious that ombre hair color would make it on the top 10 list. But here's one thing you'll want to know about wintertime ombre for 2014: it seems to be heavily popular to have darker (natural) shades at the top, and bright pastels at the bottom, like you see in this picture (a darker brown leading to pastel pink ends). So even if you're currently rocking an ombre style, feel free to switch it up and opt for the dark/super light combo.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/5b1e044904359c7c5edf6ee154fe3d30.jpg;5b1e044904359c7c5edf6ee154fe3d30

And don't you dare think, even for a second, that you have to tame it down or go dark just because it's wintertime. In fact, you should do exactly the opposite. If you're already sporting pastel locks, keep them! If you don't but have been considering the bright shades all year long, now's the time to switch it up and rock that vibrant color. Blues, greens, pinks, lavenders- the choices are limitless, and you can't go wrong with whatever color you choose.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/172856123493e815a00f2c9eaefead73.jpg;172856123493e815a00f2c9eaefead73

This look works best with very long hair, and especially a long fringe (no bangs!).

As long as the hair is a bit smoother and neater at your hairline, you can get away with fuzz and unruly locks at the back.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_15.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_15
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Close cropped do;Shoe designer Angela Simmons looks divine with her thick box braids styled in a sexy side plait. She sports very healthy edges, chunky box braids, and the odd blonde braid to mix up her look. Plaited braids are stylish and eye-catching, and we love the play on textures with small braids done in a bigger plait. Experiment with several different plaiting styles before choosing one that's both easy to create and suits your face shape and your personal style.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_16.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_16
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Sexy Senegalese twists;Mexican-Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o looks absolutely breathtaking with her glamorous close-cropped hairdo. We love the extra volume at the back, and the smooth edges of her hair. Hair this length (a particularly short TWA) can be surprisingly versatile, as you can style hair flat or comb it up and out for extra volume and glamour. With a simple hairstyle like Lupita's, you can be brave and opt for very bright and daring makeup like her electric blue eyeliner and cherry-red lips.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_16.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_16
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Pretty dark blonde braids;American recording artist and entertainer Brandy Norwood looks divine with her sexy Senegalese twists in a quirky asymmetrical up'do. Senegalese twists are also known as “rope” twists due to their braided appearance, and they are similar to kinky (or Marley) twists and Havana twists in the way they are installed. If you want to wear your braided or twisted hair in an up'do, you may be concerned about the “kitchen”, or the small section of hair at the nape of your neck that is highly resistant to styling. You can trim or shave it, create tiny curls in it, or just leave it - the choice is yours.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_17.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_17
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Mid length locs;Singing sensation Beyonce Knowles looks gorgeous with her pretty dark-blonde braids and her daughter Blue Ivy in her arms. Since your natural hair is safe inside your braided extensions, you can choose fun colors and different styles that would otherwise damage your natural hair. For a very natural look choose a shade that suits your skin tone, or go wild and choose bold and bright colors that will get you noticed in a crowd.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_17.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_17
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Slicked back;American singer-songwriter, rapper, producer, and actress Lauryn Hill looks fabulous with her mid-length locs and soft, sultry makeup. This length of locs can take around 18 months to grow and style with daily twisting and rolling, but the finished product is pretty striking. You can also install dreadlock extensions if you can't wait for your hair to grow! Finally, you can embellish your locs with beads or a scarf when you feel like a change.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_18.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_18
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Big beautiful afro;American television personality, producer, author, actress, and former model Tyra Banks looks fierce and sexy with her natural hair worn completely slicked back. Tyra is well known for her love of wigs and weaves - a style addiction that started when she was 17 and entering the modelling scene - but recently she's been embracing her natural hair a lot more. The wet-look hairstyle is chic and sexy, and easily achieved with hair gel that dries with a wet looking finish. For an extra sexy final look, wear big statement earrings and make sure that your makeup is flawless.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_18.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_18
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Micro braids and blonde extensions; American singer, songwriter, and model Solange Knowles looks fabulous with her big, beautiful afro hairstyle. We love the soft, fluffy texture of her natural hair, and her kooky side parting. The side parting creates a more interesting horizontal hairstyle, instead of the classic “halo” shaped afro. To get Solange's beautiful natural hairstyle, comb out your afro when damp/oiled with a very wide toothed comb or a pick. Brushing or combing out dry hair can cause excessive breakage, so try to avoid doing so.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_19.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_19
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Braids in a bun;American professional tennis player Venus Williams looks gorgeous with her micro braids and thin, dainty blonde extensions. We love her side-swept hairstyle, and the contemporary asymmetrical aspect of her 'do. When getting braided extensions, remember that you should only keep them in for about 6 weeks. If you keep them in any longer than that, you will run the risk of your hair locking into the braids, which means that your hair will break off when you remove the braids! So to be safe (and not unintentionally bald), make sure your braids are taken out after about 6 weeks.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_19.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_19
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Adorable pigtail plaits;American actress, singer-songwriter, and businesswoman Jada Pinkett Smith looks chic and poised with her braided extensions in a simple low bun hairstyle. The bun is a great hairstyle for keeping hair out of your face, and it looks professional and stylish too. Since braids can be quite bulky (even if they are relatively thin), you'll need to find hair ties that are strong and flexible enough to hold your hair in place.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_20.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_20
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Springy curls;American singer, songwriter and actress Keri Hilson rocks a quirky braided hairstyle featuring cornrows and adorable pigtail plaits. We love her fresh and unique personal style, with her purple dip-dyed braids and her massive hoop earrings. Natural hairstyles don't always have to look 100% natural - if your natural hair is safely braided in a protective style, get creative and add some color to the extensions, or try out a new style that expresses your personality.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_20.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_20
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Thick side plait;American singer, songwriter, actress and television personality Kelly Rowland looks gorgeous with her natural, springy curls and soft, sensual looking makeup. Springy spiral curls or coils are flirty and romantic, and we love how they surround Kelly's face like a beautiful misty halo. For best results when styling your hair, keep your naturally curly locks well-moisturized with silicone free hair care products, and prevent moisture from leaving your hair at night by wearing a silk scarf and investing in a silk pillow slip.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_21.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_21
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Spiral curls;American actress, television presenter, singer-songwriter, musician, dancer, fashion designer and activist Keke Palmer looks divine with her thick and textured side plait. Get Keke's style by first straightening your hair a bit with a hot comb or flat iron, and then creating a thick and chunky side plait. Don't worry too much about frizz and the natural texture of your hair - it adds to the romantic and carefree look you're aiming for. If your hair isn't quite this long, you can create mini plaits or braids.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_21.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_21
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Short with headband;Ethiopian model, humanitarian and social activist Gelila Bekele looks radiantly beautiful with her long spiral curls. We love the rich chocolate brown color of her locks, and the healthy shine of her curls. She wears her hair in a slightly off-centre parting that allows hair to cascade over her shoulders whilst still keeping her face unobscured. Pair your natural curls with equally natural, glowy makeup - fresh, youthful skin, nude lips, and minimal eye makeup.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_22.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_22
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Poetic Justice braids;Award winning actress Lupita Nyong'o looks phenomenal with her close-cropped hairstyle and a mini bouffant with a delicate headband. She shows us that short natural hair can be amazingly versatile, and stylish too. We love the contrasting textures of this hairstyle (smooth versus wavy), and her use of a simple headband as a sexy hair accessory. Hair accessories can update any hairstyle - look out for headbands, hair slides, scarves, clips, and even flowers that could give your hairstyle extra glamour.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_22.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_22
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Piled up Havana twists;American singer, songwriter, and actress Janet Jackson sports her famous  box braids worn up in a classy high ponytail. We love the glossy, metallic sheen of her braided extensions, and her healthy, lush edges. When wearing braids or twists in an up'do, take care not to tie your hair too tightly - pulling on your natural hair too much can cause breakage. Similarly, if you want very long or very thick braids, try not to wear them up for long periods of time. A gravity defying braid bun may look fabulous, but over time it can weaken your hair, so be careful.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_23.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_23
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Gorgeous TWA;Musician and model Solange Knowles sports thick Havana twists piled up in a stylish and eye-catching up'do. If you use Havana hair extensions for your twists (i.e., instead of Marley hair extensions), you'll have much lighter twists that won't weigh your head down. Havana hair extensions are quite a bit more expensive than Marley hair extensions, so it's a tough choice to make if you're on a budget. However, there's not much difference between the two types of hair, unless you have very sensitive edges and you'd prefer a lighter and less dense kind (i.e., Havana hair extensions).;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_23.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_23
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Super-long box braids;American actress, singer, comedienne, dancer, television producer and model Raven-Symoné looks fabulous with her gorgeous TWA and very little makeup. She sports a feathery hair accessory and a thin necklace, and a clear, glowing complexion. We love how healthy her hair is - attesting to the benefit of wearing your hair natural every now and again. Natural hairstyles allow your hair to grow and breathe, without adding extra damage every time you style your hair. Perfect for a well-deserved break during your time off or on holiday!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_241.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_24
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Jumbo cornrows;Songstress and model Solange Knowles looks strikingly beautiful with her super-long box braids in a simple up'do. Box braids are classic and chic, and they suit all styles and face shapes. They're also mid-range in price if you get them installed at a salon, although you can purchase the hair and install them yourself at home. Installation of braided extensions can be time consuming whether you have them done at a salon or you do them yourself, but the finished product is well worth it. Just remember to take them out after about 6 weeks to maintain the health of your natural hair.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_241.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_24
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Loose micro braids;American singer, songwriter, record producer, dancer, actress, and fashion model Ciara looks amazing with her jumbo cornrows and bold pink lips. She makes this common style glamorous with super shiny hair and long braids that reach the middle of her back. Keep your exposed scalp in peak condition by oiling it daily with jojoba oil or argan oil. If your edges are taking the strain from frequent styling, try massaging raw shea butter into your hairline every now and again to moisturize and nourish those soft, delicate hairs. Finally, keep your makeup flawless as this hairstyle leaves your face completely exposed and on display!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_252.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_25
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Quirky half-up braided hairdo;American actress, TV host and fashion model Eva Marcille looks fabulous with her full head of delicate micro braids. Micro braids are great as they can stay in your hair for 3 months or longer, making them both convenient and affordable. They also allow you to style your hair differently due to their smaller size and different texture.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_252.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_25
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-natural-hairstyles-for-black-women/; Sky-high afro with side parting;American actress, singer-songwriter, and businesswoman Jada Pinkett Smith looks striking with her quirky half-up braided hairdo. We love her creative take on the classic up'do, and the contrast between her loose braids and the intricate up'do section of her hairstyle. If you have braided extensions and you're getting bored of them, why not take inspiration from Jada and try out a new and interesting hairstyle?;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Natural-hairstyle-for-black-women_261.jpg;Natural hairstyle for black women_26
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Styled High;Here Rihanna is wearing a gorgeous long pixie cut but instead of letting her side swept bangs drape over he face she's styled them so they sit up high before sweeping back behind her ears. This is a fab look as it shows off all of hr face instead of hiding it. This look works best for those of you with slim face shapes such as oval or hearts. Another great thing about this look is that it's very versatile and you can wear your hair like this whether you're heading out on the town or simply going to work for the day. The only downside is that you have to set your alarm clock five minutes earlier every day as this style isn't the easiest one to master in a hurry.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0cfdc17e3eaf4e4935ccb6810263108e.jpg;Rihanna Side Swept Bangs: Styled High

Thankfully however, that myth is far from true and you can easily compromise be wearing a zig sag parting to give you the best of both worlds as Sophia Bush has done. She's wearing her bangs long so they sweep across her eye, a look that is great for partying however if you're heading off to work you may need to clip your bangs back out of your face.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0cfdc17e3eaf4e4935ccb6810263108e.jpg;Rihanna Side Swept Bangs: Styled High
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Curl Crazy;There's no hard fast rule that says bangs have to be straight and sleek. In fact they can be anything but and yet still look amazing as Hilarie Burton proved year after year when she starred in One Tree Hill. She rocked the classic perm look and even had her bangs permed, making for a fantastic stand out style. This is a great look for absolutely any face shape and any occasion so why not take the plunge and ask your stylist for a perm?;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0fefd10e367fb07d4043886a7768a4a8.jpg;Sophia Bush Side Swept Bangs: Long with a Zig Zag Parting
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Long and Flicked;Here Cameron Diaz is wearing her side swept bangs long so that they reshape the look of her face. To save her look from becoming dull however she's subtly added a flick to the ends of her bangs using curlers, something which is in complete contrast to her tucked under bob, which really adds an edge to her look. Again, this is a great style for work of play however flicked long bangs don't work for every face shape, they look best on round or square faces.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0fefd10e367fb07d4043886a7768a4a8.jpg;Sophia Bush Side Swept Bangs: Long with a Zig Zag Parting
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Gentle Curls;Sophia Bush is once again rocking her side swept bangs and this time is still wearing them long but has gently curled them to add a bit of texture to her look. This takes her look from plain to exciting with just a sweep of her curlers. This is definitely more of a 'play' look and sadly likely won't pass for long days at the office. If you've got a heart shaped face then this hairstyle is for you!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1a4cc8750b2c4766d686fb75546231e8.jpg;Hilarie Burton Side Swept Bangs: Curl Crazy
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Long and Highlighted;Cameron Diaz's style here is pretty iconic when it comes to side swept bangs and you only need to look at her to understand why! Her long sweeping bangs perfectly shape her face while not hiding away her eyes. Having side swept bangs so long is a great option as it means you can style them loads of different ways and even tie them back when you need to. Her highlights look fab too and really add a new dimension to this classic look. Sadly this isn't a great look for round or square faces but for all the rest of you then jump right in!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1a4cc8750b2c4766d686fb75546231e8.jpg;Hilarie Burton Side Swept Bangs: Curl Crazy
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Bold;I'm sure we can all appreciate how fab Rihanna's side swept bangs look her - in fact her whole style for that matter! She has her bangs pulled over her eyes to make her look mysterious however the look isn't too overpowering as she's curled her bangs along with the rest of her hair, giving it a lighter feel. Her bold red colour really makes her stand out and goes fab with her curls. This isn't what you'd call an office look but if you're heading out with friends then grab the curlers!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3ff0bb9399eeff68f62bff3d06faf7ae.jpg;Cameron Diaz Side Swept Bangs: Long and Flicked

By simply adding a few layers you instantly change your look. To make the most of this style don't smooth your bangs over to make them look sleek, ruffle them up a bit and hold them in place with a touch of hairspray to make them stand out. This is a great look for any face shape and you can even alter your look by growing your choppy bangs long or having them short.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3ff0bb9399eeff68f62bff3d06faf7ae.jpg;Cameron Diaz Side Swept Bangs: Long and Flicked

http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Long and Pinned Back;I loved having side swept bangs but couldn't help but be annoyed when they fell in my face. This doesn't seem to be a problem for Natalie Dormer however who's subtly sept her bangs off of her face and pinned them behind her ears, making for an elegant look. This is a great style for any face shape and is perfect for work, play, or even the red carpet! Ir your bangs aren't as long as Natalie's you can still experiment with this style and pin your bangs to the side higher up too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4d0d474204bb881187055c3636f780c6.jpg;Sophia Bush Side Swept Bangs: Gentle Curls
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Loose Waves;Loose waves are a great way to add a bit of texture and volume to your style without overdoing it. Unlike curls, waves suit any face shape and they make for great bangs, especially if they're as light as Rachel McAdams'. When you're styling your bangs make sure not to make them too thick or else this will ruin your look. Less is more as they say! Don't worry if all your waves aren't the same either, having them all odd in size will add to your look and make you look carefree. This is a perfect look for daytime or nighttime.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4fa30e145b0b8575815bcb9d34b3bb80.jpg;Cameron Diaz Side Swept Bangs: Long and Highlighted
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Extremely Subtle Sweep;Side swept bangs don't have to be dramatic to look great either. Take Dianna Agron's look here for example. Her bangs sweep only a tiny bit yet they still look fab. This also makes for a great look as it can be altered to be a full fringe too. If you're heading to work then this may just be the perfect look but it's also cute enough to look great on a night out too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4fa30e145b0b8575815bcb9d34b3bb80.jpg;Cameron Diaz Side Swept Bangs: Long and Highlighted

http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Short Blunt Bangs;Kristen's blunt cut really does make for a refreshing change. It really draws attention to her bangs to highlights her pretty face. My best tip for this look is to keep your bangs straight or else the blunt cut won't show up as well and the look will be lost. A few highlights are also a great way to draw attention to this unique style. This is a great loo for everyone so don't be afraid to get styling.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/5b276667df0e95e97ecdb2587e33892f1.jpg;Rihanna Side Swept Bangs: Bold Curls

Hilarie has subtly curled her bangs into one curl, twisting the hair away from her face so her eyes are left clear.

This look is best on heart shaped faces however don't be afraid to try it out even if you have a different face shape too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8f27258ea81abafbf6dd5977d1dee23e.jpg;Natalie Dormer Side Swept Bangs: Long and Pinned Back

This look also really suits the addition of hair accessories so don't be afraid to experiment with your look and see what you like.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8f27258ea81abafbf6dd5977d1dee23e.jpg;Natalie Dormer Side Swept Bangs: Long and Pinned Back
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Almost Full Fringe With A Subtle Sweep;If you've got a full fringe and would like to experiment with side swept bangs then this is a great option to get you started. Simply start off with a full fringe and gently guide your hair over to one side then keep it in place with a touch of hairspray. This is a great option if you have thick hair or simply a heavy fringe and is a perfect look for any occasion. Sadly, this look doesn't work for people with round or square faces as it makes their faces look shorter and wider but all the rest of you will look fabulous.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/9f7b85b7ed7cd95d0d16a99cdb443be5.jpg;Rachel McAdams Side Swept Bangs: Loose Waves
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Long and Thick;Dianna's look here is great, especially as her bangs only just skim her eyes. Her thick hair makes for heavy bangs but luckily the length of them means they don't fall in her eyes too often and they skim nicely around the side of her face. This loo works well if the bangs are slightly feathered at the bottom and is really set off my the addition of highlights.  This look works really well for round and square faces as it frames the face without risking making it look too wide.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/9f7b85b7ed7cd95d0d16a99cdb443be5.jpg;Rachel McAdams Side Swept Bangs: Loose Waves

She's wearing them tucked in amongst her other hair so they still frame her face and give her a side swept bang look. This is a perfect look for any occasion. The only face shape it wouldn't work on is people with a small forehead (like me!) as the hair won't fall right around your face and will fall over your eyes instead.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/021bbad36591a082024a7241be4999f71.jpg;Dianna Agron Side Swept Bangs: Extremely Subtle Sweep

Victoria's bangs are really light thanks to her thin hair which means they don't obscure her vision as they fall gracefully across her eyes. This is a great look for hitting the social scene with ad will instantly liven up your bob. It also suits longer bobs and a line styles, especially if you have a delicate face shape like our former Spice Girl has.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/26f9cc711a2c38faf090a716418aa0b5.jpg;Dianna Agron Side Swept Bangs: Flicked

http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Long Waves;Long waves for side swept bangs is always a winning look as Emma Stone proves but she's also made it look even better by pinning the other side of her hair back behind her ear so her bangs become the main focus of her look. The waves add volume if you have thin hair and take your look from plain to chic in an instant. You can use curlers to create this look but personallyI think that braiding your hair a few hours before hand will create the best wavy look possible.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/40b138b7da69d5c5829bf5cff4d15d1e.jpg;Kristen Bell Side Swept Bangs: Short Blunt Bangs

http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Choppy Bangs;Of course not all looks need to be neat and nice as Dianna Agron proves here. She's gone for a very choppy and rough look which makes her look like a bit of a rock chick. This look is a easy to create and all you need is a bit of styling product and some hairspray to get going. Sadly this look doesn't suit more formal occasions so you may need to save this look for nights out. It also doesn't suit all personalities either and you need to have a fair bit of confidence to pull it off. Still, if you're looking for a wild look then this style of bangs is perfect!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/50c5c339ec037cce8368c213d1bb7508.jpg;Candice Accola Side Swept Bangs: Long and Light Bangs

They're the perfect length to sweep around her eyes and frame her face and aren't too heavy or too light. This is a great look as it enables you to wear your hair up or down without spoiling your bangs too meaning it's perfect for wearing at the office or even on a night out. This is perhaps my favourite all round look. Its great for heart and oval shaped faces, though you'll also be able to pull it off almost as well if you have any other face shape too. I simply adore this look and think that everyone should try it at least once!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/64a83063fbcda085d02a04e7bd9072b8.jpg;Hilarie Burton Side Swept Bangs: Short and Subtle
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Extra Long;Here Jen's bangs may be extra long but don't let that fool you, they're still perfectly side swept. As her bangs are so long they're extremely versatile and she can style them most any way she wants, giving her a tonne of freedom. If you're looking for a look that won't restrict your styling options then this is a great choice. It also works for any face shapes and is a great style for helping slim down the look of your face. You can also try this style of hair lengths from medium to extra long so don't think you have to have hair the same length as Jen's to try this out.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/64a83063fbcda085d02a04e7bd9072b8.jpg;Hilarie Burton Side Swept Bangs: Short and Subtle
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Subtle Sweep;Adding just a subtle sweep to your bangs can completely change your look. This is a great style in between having a full fringe and having side swept bangs meaning it's incredibly versatile and you can style this look a few different ways. It's great for any face shape apart from round and you can wear this look to any occasion. Plus you can alter it by wearing your hair up or down too so be prepared to get experimental.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/65ae388f91544c46bc19d5b6276220241.jpg;Carey Mulligan Side Swept Bangs: Braided Backward

I love them but when they fall in my face I can't help but get a little irritated. If this is a problem you know well then this is a great style to combat it. By simply pinning your bangs back you completely change your look and suddenly your pretty face becomes the focus of your look. Why not experiment with this look and add a braid or a hair accessory to really make the most of the pinned back look?;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/65ae388f91544c46bc19d5b6276220241.jpg;Carey Mulligan Side Swept Bangs: Braided Backward
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Light and Delicate;Kate Voegel's bangs look thick but it's only the colour of her hair that creates this illusion. They're actually blissfully light and delicate which makes this a much more manageable look. Note how her bangs only just skim her eyes  and the way they curve around the face to highlight her features. Her style is very easy to create and incredibly easy to maintain so you don't have to have loads of time on your hands to look as good as Kate does here.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/83c7d159e9afacb21fe685f1b76caf17.jpg;Reese Witherspoon Side Swept Bangs: Long 
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Wind Blown;If you've been reading my other posts then you'll likely know that I love any style which has been slightly wind blown. I think it looks great as it adds a little edginess to your look and stops you from looking like a Plain Jane.  Don't worry, you don't even have to step outside to create this look either. All you need is a bit of styling product, some creativity, and a can of hairspray and you're golden. By backcombing your hair a bit you can also make this look even cooler too, especially when it comes to your bangs. Windswept bangs are incredibly easy to create and they look fabulous!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/83c7d159e9afacb21fe685f1b76caf17.jpg;Reese Witherspoon Side Swept Bangs: Long 
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Neat Bangs;In complete contrast to the last picture we now see Hilary Duff with extremely near bangs, a style which is perfect for hitting the office with. This style is great as you can wear it with your hair up down, windswept, curled, anything! It also looks great on all face shapes too making this a truly versatile look. Hilary's bangs are the perfect length as they sweep across her brows and don't hide her pretty eyes from view. They highlight her face wonderfully.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/211a873471f8616e111480cb2ffe831d.jpg;Hilarie Burton Side Swept Bangs: Curls

Her bangs taper beautifully to the side, showing off the majority of her face which still drawing attention to it. I'd also like to note how the rest of her hair perfectly frames her face too. This is a great look for round faces and is perfect for most any occasion.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/211a873471f8616e111480cb2ffe831d.jpg;Hilarie Burton Side Swept Bangs: Curls

Wavy bangs like this aren't the easiest style to create I'll admit but once you get them right they look fantastic. Always remember to finish this style off with hairspray or your bangs will no doubt be falling back across your face in hours if you don't. This look is perfect for oval faces and looks great for hitting the social scene.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/861f2cb3557cb05925c06d34cd31b465.jpg;Carey Mulligan Side Swept Bangs: Gentle Waves
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Slicked Back;This is one of my favourite variations of side swept bangs and is the perfect look for any formal occasion! This works best for pixie cuts but with enough hairspray you can make this look work for long hair too. This is a great way to instantly transform your look and get your bangs out of your face for the evening while still looking utterly fabulous. This is definitely a win for Carey Mulligan.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/861f2cb3557cb05925c06d34cd31b465.jpg;Carey Mulligan Side Swept Bangs: Gentle Waves

http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Gentle Wave;Rachel's look here doesn't have what I'd call wavy bangs however there is a slight wave to her bangs which is where the title came from. This wave gives her hair volume which still keeping her look incredibly simple. More like than not this wave is natural meaning this style is very easy to replicate, even if you have just rolled out of bed. This look is fab for any occasion and this style of bangs will flatter square faces most of all (though I encourage you to try it still if you have a different face shape!).;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/5064ec2153c8e3398506d25586b0f2d0.jpg;Dianna Agron Side Swept Bangs: Long and Thick
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Overlapping Bangs;Taylor Swift has two layers to her bangs here, one of which overlaps the other creating volume in her look. This look is simple to create yet very unusual which will help the wearer stand out in a crowd. You can also alter this look so it looks great at any occasion, a definite pro. Oval face shapes will look the best with this fab style.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8372a2bdb4fb08324da0d034b1d54f8f.jpg;Katy Perry Side Swept Bangs: Long

They're very easy to manage, especially at this length which will really flatter any face shape, and they're also nice enough to wear socially too. You can style them by adding a curl or some waves for other occasions too. As Gwyneth shows, this type of bang is perfect for wearing with your hair up, especially if it's nice and straight.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8372a2bdb4fb08324da0d034b1d54f8f.jpg;Katy Perry Side Swept Bangs: Long

I love Emma's long side swept bangs, especially as they're a little bit rugged which adds an edge to her chic style. This look is perfect for formal occasions and by simply letting the rest of your hair fall loose you're instantly transformed and ready for social occasions too. This is a really easy to create style too which gives it some serious bonus points.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/21029fb7f7d305759644b00fe5c92383.jpg;Kiera Knightley Side Swept Bangs: Worn Tied Back
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-side-swept-bangs/; Highlights;Just simply adding a few highlights to your bangs will instantly transform your whole look. It's a great way of brightening your face and making your bangs go from boring to alive. You can also get lowlight too but in my experience highlights gives the better effect when done on bangs. Try not to stray too far from your natural colour as this may spoil your look, instead keep it subtle for the best results.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/21029fb7f7d305759644b00fe5c92383.jpg;Kiera Knightley Side Swept Bangs: Worn Tied Back

http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Long Beach Waves;Beach waves is a classic style that most anyone can pull off however you're almost guaranteed to wear it better if you have thick, long hair. You can create beach waves by using your curlers or rollers but personally I think the best way is to simply braid your hair ahead of time and let your hair curl itself naturally. By braiding your hair your waves will be soft, natural, and slightly uneven which will enhance this look. Add a little hairspray so your style lasts longer too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0b545d1cd527c396db170aa9735662401.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair1
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Short and Choppy;By adding layers to your thick hair you make it instantly less bulky and therefore much more manageable. This is true of Emma Watson's fabulous style. She's had her chin length hair cut into choppy layers, making for an edgy, chic and carefree look. This style works best on heart or oval shaped faces but don't be afraid to try it out if you have a square or round face too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0b545d1cd527c396db170aa9735662401.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair1
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Short Soft Curls;While any woman can pull of curls whether her hair is thick or thin, I find curls always look better on thick hair, namely because of the volume thick hair gives them. By curling short hair which often sticks to the head, you instantly transform your look and volumes it. If you've got a round face you should wear very big curls and give your hair as much volume as possible but for those of you with a petite face like Kiera you can wear gentle curls.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1d7ee520e9c1f78e835bad1e7f5c8639.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair2
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Pretty in Pink – Unruly Colour;Coloured highlights are a great addition to any style but especially a short and choppy one like Rachel McAdams' hair. The great thing about having thick hair is that you instantly have volume and texture without even trying, something that will make your highlights really stand out and take on a life of their own. Rachel looks fab with her pink highlights but of course you're free to choose any colour you think will suit you.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1d7ee520e9c1f78e835bad1e7f5c8639.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair2
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Low Ponytail;Low ponytails are always a great look, especially if you hair is thick and therefore has a bit of volume to it. When you're pulling your long or medium hair into a low ponytail, try not to make it too tight. Leave flyaway hairs to give your look that little something extra like Natalie. Also, you can add a few curls to your ponytail to rally set your look off.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2f4085d760d0367800c9eec72068d75b.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair3
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Long Side Braid;I love side braids, they're probably one of my favourite hairstyle, and I can tell you that they definitely look better when done on thick hair. This is because your braid will have much more bounce to it, and you can even tease it apart to make it look thicker still. Also, to make the most of showing off your thick hair don't bundle all of your hair into your braid. Leave some of it flying free so your thick hair really catches people's eyes.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2f4085d760d0367800c9eec72068d75b.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair3
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Long Ponytail;While ponytails can be frustrating to create if you have thick hair which insists on being unruly, they're worth the effort you put into them. As you can see from Selena, thick ponytails look great due to all the volume in them, something you can't achieve naturally with thin hair. The longer your hair the better for this look, ladies, but you can still give this style a bash if you have medium hair too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3b5a1ef668c0d9cf25b7665326527a242.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair4
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;Elegant Curls;This is perhaps Miley's best look if you ask me, and her brilliant style is enhanced by her beautifully thick hair. She's curled her medium length curls to make her look like she's walked right out the twenties, a style which is really coming back into fashion right now. Her thick hair gives her curls more volume, adding to her look, and her various layers mean it all sits nicely together.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3b5a1ef668c0d9cf25b7665326527a242.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair4
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; High Ponytail;While even people with thin hair can make high ponytails, they tend to look a little limp and lifeless. If you've got thick hair however that isn't the case. Your high ponytail will look fab and full from hairband to hair tip, giving you a fab look. The longer the hair the better for this look, but if you've got medium hair you can still attempt it. Useful tip: the higher the ponytail the longer your hair will look.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3ce6fffe2f8c78c8f903f0a46a1feb58.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair5

This is a great style for all face shapes except for round faces (a longer pixie style will suit them better) and also a style I think everyone should try at least once.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3ce6fffe2f8c78c8f903f0a46a1feb58.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair5
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Full Fringe;Yes, yes, I hear you, people with thin hair often have full fringes too. Well, that's true but they don't wear them nearly as well. This is because as soon as any heat (hairdryers, straighteners etc) go near their fringe it suddenly looks thinner than ever and the style is lost. Those of you with thick hair won't have that problem however. Anyone can pull off a fringe too, though if you've got a round face I advise going with a blunt fringe over a rounded one.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4e9c483926e1a763cc9f28c5435c1bdb.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair6
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Medium Bob;Medium bobs look great on thick hair, especially if you add no layers to it like Selena as this makes it look even thicker. This is a great style whether you're professional or planning on going out partying, plus it suits any face shape so you don't have to worry about it not suiting you. This style also looks super cute if you tuck one side of your hair behind your ear.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4e9c483926e1a763cc9f28c5435c1bdb.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair6
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; High Big Bun;If you've got thin hair then you can easily achieve a thick bun by using a doughnut however if you have naturally thick hair you can great an even more natural looking affect without quite so much hassle. This style works for long hair and can be done by first tying you hair into a high ponytail and then looping your hair around and fastening it into this fab looking bun. This style can be done in minutes, though you wouldn't think it with how great it looks.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6a7e1962c9d12650c2eef95d7593ecdd.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair7
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Brushed Back Long Pixie Cut;This is a great style whether you're planning on working or playing. It's a great way to change up your pixie cut and really works for thick hair because of the amount of volume your hair will create. You'll need to use a bit of product topped off with a bit of hairspray to create this look but after that you'll be golden. The only face shape this doesn't really work for is round faces.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6a7e1962c9d12650c2eef95d7593ecdd.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair7
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Boho Long Waves;Boho long waves look great if you've got thick hair because your hair will add to the unruly nature of your look. To get the best out of this look, make your waves and curls a little uneven like Kate Hudson has done. You can try this with medium length hair but in all honesty it doesn't really have the same effect. Those of you with long hair will definitely rock this look best.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6e27a11d675af691344666810736cb8c.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair8
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Half Shaves Pixie Haircut;Pixie hairstyles look great on people with thick hair as they tend to have a lot more volume and look bouncier. I love this shaves look as it's undeniably cute. This is a style that only face shape can pull off too - now it's just a case of you finding the courage to shave half your head.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6e27a11d675af691344666810736cb8c.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair8
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Fancy Long Poytail;Ponytails don't have to be boring, in fact they can be incredibly fancy as Katy Perry shows us here. By taking a few strands of your hair and moulding them into an undo you bring new life to your hair and are much more likely to stand out in a crowd. Be as creative as you dare with this one, ladies, this style is one you can truly make your own.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7d0a46394a39ed02f8aafa07c42ca980.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair9
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Ruffled Pixie Haircut;Like I said before, pixie haircuts are great for thick hair as they don't cling to your head and look flat. This is especially true if you ruffle your hair up a bit like J. Law has done here. This is a great style and one which looks different every time you do it. You can use a bit of product to create this style but personally I prefer just running fingers through the hair and then finishing it off with a touch of hairspray, no fuss needed.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7d0a46394a39ed02f8aafa07c42ca980.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair9
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Regular Ponytail;So I covered high ponytails, low ponytails, and even fancy ponytails earlier but I just wanted to remind you all that there's nothing at all wrong with regular ponytails. Again, they look great with thick hair as they have a lot more volume and bounce to them. This is a fab style for any face shape and perfect for a day at the office.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/07d7470d93659e56612f89a73bcd56b9.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair10
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Long Perm;Perms look fab on long, thick hair, mostly because they have much more life about them. They don't look dull and flat, they look bouncy and luscious. There's a perm for every face shape too, each of them done differently and creating different types of curls to suit you. You can get perms done of medium hair too but they tend to look far better on long hair like Rihanna's. Oh, and the thicker your hair the better your perm will take.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/07d7470d93659e56612f89a73bcd56b9.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair10
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Side Swept;I love seeing women with all their thick hair swept over to one side, and often pinned in place. This is a great look as it stops your hair tom falling across one side of your face and creates a lush, volumised pile of hair on your other shoulder. It's a very chic and elegant look but you can also style it to make it look casual or even very professional. Why not add a few curls to mix it up too?;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8a464d7dc494d9bdcae43da4c9a7a42a.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair11
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Dip Dyed;Okay, so this is a style for thin hair as well as thick hair but I'm including it because it's a style you should never overlook. Dip dying is great and can instantly transform your hair and change your look. You can go with a bold colour like Candice or if that's not really you then you can always go down the route of having a natural coloured dip dye. Don't be afraid to experiment and ask your stylist for advice.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8a464d7dc494d9bdcae43da4c9a7a42a.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair11
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Half Pinned Back;Accessorising  is by far the easiest and quickest way to restyle your hair without any fuss. You can use hairbands, grips, or (my favourite choice) hats to change up your look. Hats look great with thick hair as your hair is less likely to go limp beneath them so you still keep your style. You don't have to have your hair braided like Candice to wear a hat either - why not experiment with tying your hair up, low buns, curls, and wearing your hair loose too?;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8f83384096f83f247695caa1d76ebd151.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair12
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Long and Straight;The biggest problem I have with my thick hair is that it's always falling forward as it's so heavy, something that this style combats. By pinning half of your hair back you instantly change your look and reveal your pretty face to the world. You can use a number of different types to do this so be sure to choose the type that suits where you're headed best. Take Hayden for example: her glittery pins are perfect for the red carpet and really make her look like she belongs.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8f83384096f83f247695caa1d76ebd151.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair12
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Long Central Braid;When you straighten thin hair it tends to go even thinner the second the heat touches it, often making it look incredibly limp and lifeless. For those of you with thick hair you won't have that problem however which means that the straight look is something you can really rock.  This look is perfect for any face shape and is also something that you can pull of casually, at a formal event, at work, on a night out - literally anywhere! It's smart, casual, and chic all in one. Plus, you'll love the shine straightening your hair gives it.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/9e8d180180db0f0c34561a3c9704d48a.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair13
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Long Curls and Soft Bangs;Central braids look fabulous at all times but especially if they're done on long, thick hair like Nina Dobrev has. They're a great choice for any face shape as you can alter them to include your bangs styles how best suits you. The biggest downside to them is that they're a nightmare to do singlehandedly so you may have to enlist the help of a friend or partner to create one for you. Other that that however they're a fabulous choice of style.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/9e8d180180db0f0c34561a3c9704d48a.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair13
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Rock Chick/Boho Long Half Up Do;Long curls look great on thick hair because they have so much volume and texture. They tend to stay in longer than they would on thin hair too. The great thing about curls is you can alter them to be as large or small as you like which means you can adapt them to any face shape or occasion. I'd also like to point out J.Law's fabulous, soft fringe. She has a full fringe but it's been cut so it falls very softly and doesn't take over her look, something which thick hair can often do. If you're getting a fringe, try a one like this. One which looks grey but isn't too heavy due to your thick hair.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/09fb8d214d2f12ff83971a9b10b9dc65.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair14
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; MediumLengthElegance;I'm not even sure where to begin when it comes to telling you why this style is fantastic. You only need to look at it to tell! Here Hilary is wearing her long hair in a half up do but has used a mixture of curls and waves to changer her style from prim and proper to a cross between a rock chick and boho, a unique combo. Note how not a single strand of her her hair is perfect, but yet because none of her hair is perfect it all looks pretty damn hot. I know, it's an odd thing to comprehend but you only need to look at her to know why this style works. If you're thinking of going for this style just remember to lock it in place with a little hairspray.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/09fb8d214d2f12ff83971a9b10b9dc65.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair14
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Gentle MediumLengthWaves;I always think medium length hair is a bit of an odd length as it's not really long enough to style yet it's long enough to need styling all the same. This style worn by Emma Watson is a great use of medium length hair and makes it love incredibly cute and elegant. Emma has curled her hair gently and pulled it back off of her face by securing a few strands with subtle pins. I also love how she's kept her bangs down on one side to frame her face, something you ought to experiment with to see what way your bangs should be worn to suit your face shape.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/28a2b0e2eb48d2853ec10a96e1424a68.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair15
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Thick Fringe;Your hairstyle doesn't need to be elaborate, in fact it can be incredibly simple and still look fabulous as Katy Perry shows us with her head of gently waves. Her waves are very subtle yet they add a new dimension and a layer of volume to her thick hair. This is a great style if you're looking for something quick and easy and one that's easily maintained throughout the day. Just add a bit of hairspray and you're good to go.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/28a2b0e2eb48d2853ec10a96e1424a68.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair15
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Half Curls;While Sophia Bush's fringe may look thick and heavy, it's actually an illusion due to the natural volume of her hair. Her look is created using minimal hair yet still looks gorgeous. This is a great tip if you're thinking of getting a full fringe. That said, full fringes don't tend to suit round faces so you may want to consider a different type of bangs. If you've got a delicate face shape however then jump right in!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/57cd47165e8bb688df4cb1fcd02c401e.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair16
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; All Ove Perm;Sometimes curling all of your hair can be too much for thick hair and adds too much volume however this style worn by Rachel McAdams is a great alternative. By just curling one half of her hair she creates a volumised look that's chic and classic yet without making her hair too big. This is a great style if you have a round face as it means you don't run the risk of making it look any rounder, though as you can see from Rachel McAdams it works for more delicate face shapes too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/57cd47165e8bb688df4cb1fcd02c401e.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair16
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Long and Natural;Of course some people do suit having curls all over their head, especially if they have a delicate face shape. Hilarie Burton wore this style on One Tree Hill for years and had hoards of girls pining for her amazing style. This look works best on delicate faces and tends to stay in longer on people with medium length hair.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/75e5667ad9086553f52b5d2314097ce6.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair17
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Rough Bob;Remind me again why people with long, thick hair are even bothering to style their hair? Call me crazy, but I think the natural look really works, something which Miley proves to be true in this picture. Her long hair looks gorgeous and is full of volume as it's so thick. For days when you can't be bothered to style your hair don't fret - simply grab the hairbrush and head out the front door. You're sure to look fabulous either way.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/75e5667ad9086553f52b5d2314097ce6.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair17
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Low Side Bun;I love Kiera's rough bob here. She looks so chic despite her hair being somewhat ragged, a style which really suits her. Note how her hair has no layers, making it look even thicker, something which you ought to do too if you're considering this style. This style is great for oval and heart shaped faces but it's not likely to suit people with square or round face shapes.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/81d37d55fe0e7e5c795bd689d5c38e3f.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair18
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Sleek Pixie Haircut;Low side buns are a fantastic choice for thick hair (the longer the better) as they're pretty quirky, fashionable, chic, and professional all in one. They work best on long thick hair as this makes for a bigger bun and in this case I say the unrulier the hair the better. You just have look at J.Law to see how well her messy side bun works so don't worry if you can't create the perfect side bun, it's no big deal.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/81d37d55fe0e7e5c795bd689d5c38e3f.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair18
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; ShoulderLengthCurls;I've seen women with thick and thin hair try the pixie cut and from experience I can tell you that the style works way better on thick hair as your look will still have a bit of life to it and won't end up clinging to your head. To make the most of this look you'll likely need to wash your hair daily (something I wouldn't normally advise) and steer clear of conditioner for the most part too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/89c094fbd5a48977a70c1f89061d158c.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair19
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; ShoulderLengthCurls;Shoulder length curls is an incredibly classy style, as Miley shows off above. The good thing about having thick hair to do this style is that it makes your curls look even bigger, a big pro since it can be hard to create decent curls on this length of hair anyway. Also, take a look at Miley's cute, natural coloured dip dye. This really adds a little something extra to her look if you ask me.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/89c094fbd5a48977a70c1f89061d158c.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair19
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Colour Crazy;Here's another variation of shoulder length curls for you but this time the curls are far more extensive, making for a bolder and slightly less tameable look. Anne looks fantastic here and her hair is full of life. The only downside to having these super sized curls is that they won't work quite as well on round faces. While you can use curlers to create this look, I think that rollers are the most effect way to do this.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/534e9bdb1877f0e22a787cb6c01f387b.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair20
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Headband;One of my favourite things about thick hair is how textured it is, something which Katy Perry's colour crazy look really makes the most of. By colouring your hair lots of different shades you really show off how thick it is and will wow people with your lucious locks. Don't worry if your'e not up from being as bright as Katy. P. either, you can create the same illusion using more natural tones with a few highlights or lowlights thrown in for added effect.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/534e9bdb1877f0e22a787cb6c01f387b.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair20
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Low Bun;Like I said before, I love thick hair but it really annoys me too as it can sometimes fall in your way. By simply adding a hairband like Emma Watson has done you stylishly combat this issue. Her's is a very subtle addition but you can be as flamboyant as you like. I love seeing headbands with flowers on them but it really depends on where you're headed and the tone of your day. The best way to choose a headband is to make it match your outfit.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0618fac78d80832d061af1b233091796.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair21
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Bold and Beautiful;Low buns are great and incredibly stylish too. You'll be pleased to hear that they're much easier to create than low side buns too. When you're setting your bun, try to make it about the same height as J. Laws - any lower and it will likely brush on any high necked clothes you're wearing and will probably fall out prematurely. Of course, a little hairspray goes a long way to combat this.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0618fac78d80832d061af1b233091796.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair21
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Side Swept Bob;Few changes to your hair make more of a statement than adding a bold colour to your look. This is of course something you can try on any hair length but the longer the better as this will make way more of a statement. In truth you need not go quite this bright, you can create the same impact with natural colours too like going from brunette to blonde etc.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/656a1b304557c77659604f41785da31a.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair22
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Classy Long Bob;So we've already covered why bobs are great for thick hair but before we wrap up I wanted to mention the side swept bob. This is one of the few bob styles I suggest adding a few layers to as the extra texture goes a long way. The side swept look is great for helping to make round or square faces look more delicate too, especially if you have bangs like RiRi.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/656a1b304557c77659604f41785da31a.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair22
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Half Up Do;I love this classy long bob from Hayden. It looks amazing swept back of her face, a style you can create easily simply by blow-drying your hair into the desired position. A few short layers really add to this look but be sure not to overdo it or your hair won't look as thick as you'd like it too. You can try this look if you have a fringe but if I'm honest it won't work nearly half as well.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/5846bacd62e3a14775044e144c5b1930.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair23
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Coloured Highlights;Okay, so I've called it a half up of but Selena hasn't actually needed to use anywhere near as much hair to create this stunning look. That's the great thing about thick hair however, you don't need much to make an impact. This is a style that definitely works best if you have long hair as it means all the hair you've pinned back will fall beautifully down your back. You could also try straightening or curling your hair to add to this style.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/5846bacd62e3a14775044e144c5b1930.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair23
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Plaited Bun;You don't need many but a few highlights (preferably coloured) will go a long way to brightening up your hair. By adding highlights to thick hair you automatically give the illusion of more volume, something which Nina proves here. Also, by curling her hair it makes this look even better and makes her look classy, casual, professional and chic all at the same time. This is one of my favourite styles on the list.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7055ea0d9da7b1288cb7b525a36b8441.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair24
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Braided Bangs;If your hair is long enough to braid when it's in a ponytail when you ought to try turning that braid into a bun for the stunning look Emma has here. This works great for thick hair as the thicker your hair the bigger the bun - the same goes for long hair too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7055ea0d9da7b1288cb7b525a36b8441.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair24
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thick-hair/; Wavy Bob;Another great way to get your thick hair off of your face is to French braid them out of the way like Hayden has. This is a great look for all face shapes.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8889d3b7a705e9460fdc1dfa39602c04.jpg;Hairstyle For Thick Hair25
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thin-hair/; A Line Bob;This is a great hairstyle for thin hair because it can be worn naturally (i.e. without being straightened or curled) and still look fabulous. The great thing about a-line styles is that they suit any face shape and you can have your bangs tapered to look even better. Ask your stylist what length is good for you and how they recommend you wear you bangs - my personal advice is that if you have a round face go with long bangs and the slimmer the face the shorter they can be.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0afe229b178f02ecb4d34c20eae0ba57.jpg;Hairstyles For Thin Hair1
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thin-hair/;Array;Thin hair is renowned for looking limp but with all the styling options these days that need no longer be the case. Look at Drew for instance - she has very fine hair but you wouldn't know it looking at this picture. She's used a mix of curlers and styling gels to make her hair look big and beautiful. This is a great tip for anyone with thin hair, no matter your hair length or face shape.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0afe229b178f02ecb4d34c20eae0ba57.jpg;Hairstyles For Thin Hair1
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thin-hair/; Curled and Wild;This is a similar idea to what we say in number two. Dianna has taken a simple bob and used layers to make it look choppy, thus helping her to achieve more volume and combatting the sleek look of her thin hair. Like I said, you can do this at any length but I think there's a timeless charm to bobs.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0c5283b23f0957fc61b7d646c432005b.jpg;Hairstyles For Thin Hair2
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thin-hair/;Array;I love pixie cuts full stop but they definitely work better for girls with with fine hair over thick hair. This is a great option because it's incredibly stylish and once your hair has been trimmed short no one will ever be able to tell if it's thick or not. The only face shape which this may not suit is round faces, though there are a few variations you could consider if you're determined to go pixie.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0c5283b23f0957fc61b7d646c432005b.jpg;Hairstyles For Thin Hair2
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thin-hair/; Choppy Bob;Carey Mulligan always looks fabulous and I bet you never even noticed how fine her hair is. That's probably because she always styles it beautifully so how fine it is no longer matters.

This style works best for people with medium to long hair and you'll be pleased to hear it works on any face shape too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/90e3e17bb37238b2b9d48e304fe5c6e5.jpg;90e3e17bb37238b2b9d48e304fe5c6e5
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thin-hair/; Cute Bangs;Bangs work for most people but personally I've always thought they work better on thin hair as they're more tameable. Here Scarlett shows us her cute, rounded bangs. Note that they look thick yet they don't look heavy - this is because of her thin hair. Of course this style doesn't work for everyone and it's best steered clear of if you have too thin a face but if you have a heart shaped face you're golden.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/96d82d410d7ed61317cf086e0daf908e.jpg;96d82d410d7ed61317cf086e0daf908e
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thin-hair/; Untamed Pixie Cut;I'll be the first to admit that I was devastated when J. Law cut off all her beautiful long hair and replaced it with her pixie cut. That said, it didn't take me long to get over it after seeing how fabulous she now looks. While her hair isn't incredibly thin, it's not what you'd call thick either. This is perhaps why her pixie cut works so well when it's all roughed up like this. This style works best if you have a slim face but different variations of it do work on round faces too so don't be scared to experiment. This is also a great look is you have highlights as they add an extra look of depth to your style.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/96d82d410d7ed61317cf086e0daf908e.jpg;96d82d410d7ed61317cf086e0daf908e
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thin-hair/; Sleek Ponytail;Styles like this is why you should love your thin hair. Sure, everyone can wear a ponytail but it doesn't work quite this well on thick hair. Gwen's ponytail is smooth, sleek, professional, an completely natural. If you've got thin hair they you don't need to fuss with straighteners, just grab your hairband and your brush and you're near good to go. You can pull this hair off if you have bangs like we saw Emma Stone do earlier too but by pulling all your hair back you make this is a style any face shape can wear. This is perfect for wearing to the office, at a party, or even when you're just lounging in the house.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/181b6fcea160cd10f479918b62a6df40.jpg;181b6fcea160cd10f479918b62a6df40
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thin-hair/; Long Sleek With A Center Parting;Kate Hudson's thin hair looks fabulous here. She's simply letting it flow and making it look like it's been styled for hours, even though her thin hair is naturally straight. Her centre parting really helps her look  as it creates a balance so no one side of her hair looks to heave and no one side looks overly thin. This style is so easy to create, works for any hair length and face shape, and incredibly natural. You can always add a few layers to this style to make it look more interesting but personally I love it sleek and straight like Kate's.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/181b6fcea160cd10f479918b62a6df40.jpg;181b6fcea160cd10f479918b62a6df40
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thin-hair/; Cute A Line Bob;Hayden has quite a round face yet she pulls off this A line bob perfectly. The reason? Her thin hair of course! It means her hair doesn't look too thick therefore doesn't make her face look wider. Instead she winds up looking elegant, chic, sassy, and oh so stylish. This is perhaps her best look! Plus, this style works really well as she's so short. It means her hair isn't cutting her body in half and makes her look taller than she is - a great tip for those of you who are short like me!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/267e0e8b501149a3b8b4c94abec4e9b0.jpg;267e0e8b501149a3b8b4c94abec4e9b0
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-hairstyles-for-thin-hair/; Short and Curled;   And finally we come to our last picture where Vanessa Anne Hudgens shows off her sleek, short curls. The reason this style works so well for thin hair is because it adds an awful lot of volume in just a small space, transforming her look instantly. If you've got a round face you may want to stay away from this look but for those of you with a heart or an oval shaped face this look is bound to suit you. Experiment with curl tightness to see what different looks you can create too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/267e0e8b501149a3b8b4c94abec4e9b0.jpg;267e0e8b501149a3b8b4c94abec4e9b0
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Classic Beach Waves;Of course, no list of summer hairstyles would be complete without mentioning classic beach waves. This in my opinion is the perfect summer style. It's quick, it's easy, it looks great, it doesn't matter if it gets a little windswept (in fact it probably looks better then!), and it works no matter your face shape or what type of bangs you have. Provided your hair is long enough to add waves to there's no reason you can't do this classic summer style.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0b545d1cd527c396db170aa973566240.jpg;0b545d1cd527c396db170aa973566240
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Classic Pontyail;I love being outside during summer, as I'm sure most of you do. There's just something about the warm air and the gentle breeze that I find alluring. The biggest problem with being outdoors so much however is that you'll find your hair all too often gets tangled from being exposed to the wind. This makes it unruly and often sore to brush out. To combat this, why not use a classic summer ponytail? You will look great, your hair doesn't get tangled, plus more of your skin will be exposed for tanning.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0b545d1cd527c396db170aa973566240.jpg;0b545d1cd527c396db170aa973566240
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Slick Ponytail;For some people a classic ponytail just isn't stylish enough, plus it still exposes you to the risk of a few strands of hair being windswept. Still, a ponytail is a great idea if you're facing a windy, summer day so why not try out this slick ponytail? By pulling your hair back ever tighter you're creating a sleek look which is virtually untouchable by the wind. Plus, more of your skin is exposed for tanning as I mentioned earlier. The one downside I'll point out is that you shouldn't wear this style too often or it could damage your hair.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0d54d2553e049f7f7f555fb4c177ab43.jpg;0d54d2553e049f7f7f555fb4c177ab43
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Rockchick Waves;This is the perfect hairstyle whether you're thinking of hitting a festival or are just going for a stroll on the beach. It looks somewhat similar to classic beach waves but with a little more attitude. The overall effect doesn't have to be quite as precise and it doesn't matter if some curls and waves are smaller than others. By pulling some strands back like Hilary Duff you're exposing your face more, allowing you to get a summer glow, and you're adding to the rock chick style. Rule number one of this look - don't worry if it's a little bit messy, it will just enhance your look.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0d54d2553e049f7f7f555fb4c177ab43.jpg;0d54d2553e049f7f7f555fb4c177ab43
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Choppy Bob With Coloured Highlights;I'm a massive fan of the choppy bob hairstyle like Rachel McAdams is modelling above. It's great because you can style it anyway you like meaning it's suitable for any face shape. If you've got long hair and are considering a change this summer I highly recommend this style. Plus, why not try adding a splash of colour to really bring your style to life too? Or maybe a few colours? This is a fab idea if you're going to a festival!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0e37589d1870669de9a5668a7a8cd03b.jpg;0e37589d1870669de9a5668a7a8cd03b
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Permed;Curls seem to be all the rage when summer time comes around. Some people find themselves spending hours daily curling their hair and so I ask you, why not get your hair permed so it's permanently curled (or at least for a few months). That way you'll have loads more time to spend enjoying the summer sun. Hilarie Burton looks great with her tight curls but some people don't suit them. If you've got a rounder face you'd likely suit loose curls better. Before taking the plunge consult your stylist on what type of curls would suit you best.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0e37589d1870669de9a5668a7a8cd03b.jpg;0e37589d1870669de9a5668a7a8cd03b
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Flower Up Do and Coloured Hair;If you're looking for a truly unique style to hit the festivals with then you'll love this summer flower up do. All you need to do to create it is to pull all your hair back and tie it into a messy bun and simply slide your favourite summer flowers in around the crown. To make the most of this effect why not dye your hair a startling colour like Drew Barrymore has done. This will create a truly memorable summer look.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1fa8c1feda8dfef988b07d057e2acb7d.jpg;1fa8c1feda8dfef988b07d057e2acb7d
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Simple;If you don't have much time to do your hair before heading out into the sun then why not do something really simple like Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner. She looks beautiful and ready to take on summer here yet with minimal effort. All you need to do to create this look is brush out your hair, sweep ones side of it behind your ear and pin it in place with a delicate sum me flower.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1fa8c1feda8dfef988b07d057e2acb7d.jpg;1fa8c1feda8dfef988b07d057e2acb7d
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Half Waves;If you've got a round or heart shapes face you might find that a full head of waves is too much of you. In that case a flattering alternative is to have only half your head waved. This means only waving or curling the bottom half of your hair and straightening the top half. This is far more flattering to round face shapes yet still gives you a great summer look.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3b5a1ef668c0d9cf25b7665326527a241.jpg;3b5a1ef668c0d9cf25b7665326527a24
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; BoldAccessorisedUp Do;If you fancy a real stand out summer style then this is a great look to do for. There are so many great thing about this style of Rihanna's! Firstly, her bold choice of colour is perfect for summer. Secondly, her curled up do just screams 'festival'. And thirdly, she's done a great job of accessorising her style a her wonderfully summery bow. Note how she's matched her bow colour to her hair - this is a tip you should always follow when style. Make sure the colour of your accessory is suitable.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3b5a1ef668c0d9cf25b7665326527a241.jpg;3b5a1ef668c0d9cf25b7665326527a24
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Delicate Braid with Layers;I love seeing long, chunky braids in summer time - it's a great festival style - but never fear if your hair isn't long enough to do this, there is a great alternative. This style by Emily Osment is the perfect way to still wear a summer braid even if you have fine, layered hair. Note how she's only braided the underside of her hair, creating a delicate braid, and had gently curled her top layers. This creates a truly dynamic loco with tonnes of texture.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3b097ae3701a9247043c3964794533e6.jpg;3b097ae3701a9247043c3964794533e6
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Centre Braid;Here Nina Dobrev is wearing is beautiful braid which spawns from the centre of her head, not the side as you often see. Note how she's teased the braid to make it look thicker. This is a great look if you want a style a little less intrusive than a side braid or if you have medium length hair too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3b097ae3701a9247043c3964794533e6.jpg;3b097ae3701a9247043c3964794533e6
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Sleek and Straight;Of course there's no rule that says summer hairstyles have to be complicated. Take Kate Hudson's look here for example. All she's done is gently straightened her hair, making it look sleek, stylish, and effortless. This is a great choice for a summer style if you don't have much time to work on your hair. Plus, it's a great all year round look too so you need not stop wearing it come fall. Even better, this look can be pulled off no matter your face shape or your hair length.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3fad91781522bf4d6bc89b45caa87066.jpg;3fad91781522bf4d6bc89b45caa87066
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Long Curls;This is one of my favourite styles of all time - long curls. In my opinion, curls look fab no matter the season and on any length hair but there's no denying that Miley looks great here with he flowing locks. If you've got highlighted hair or are looking to get them then I definitely recommend this style. This is a great look for summer as it's a simple twist on beach waves.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3fad91781522bf4d6bc89b45caa87066.jpg;3fad91781522bf4d6bc89b45caa87066
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Thick Side Braid;Remember before when I told you about thick side braids? Well this is them! Doesn't it look great? To make the most of this look don't strive to make your braid look printing. It looks even better if you have a few fly aways and your layers are allowed to flow freely like Miley's. This is a style that works for most face shapes but you'll find it works best on round and heart shapes faces. Try playing with your bangs in this style to see where they look best too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4d705e2ba88617cec273514d4173e5d3.jpg;4d705e2ba88617cec273514d4173e5d3
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Half Up Do;This is a fab style for summer as it takes mere minutes to do, giving you more time to spend in the sun, plus it gets hair off your face so you can soak up a summer glow. There are lots of variations of this style but the best is this classic, simple style shown here by Rachel Bilson. Why not try experimenting by curling your loose hair and pinning the top of your hair back in different ways?;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4d705e2ba88617cec273514d4173e5d3.jpg;4d705e2ba88617cec273514d4173e5d3
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Loose Layers;If it's a windy day but you don't want to tie all of your hair back then this is a great alternative. Just tie back the majority of your hair but leave your layers to flow freely in the breeze. Selena Gomez really rocks this look, doesn't she? Especially with her curled layers!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/5abeb1be68ad49b1e4b2874786402c55.jpg;5abeb1be68ad49b1e4b2874786402c55
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Side Swept Wavy Bob;Bobs are perfect for summer as they're easy to maintain and expose more of your skin to the sun. I love Scarlett Johansson's style here - her wavy bob looks fab and the fact thats she's swept her hair into a side parting makes the style look even better. She's really captured a lot of texture and volume in her look. This look is best work if you have a slim face.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/5abeb1be68ad49b1e4b2874786402c55.jpg;5abeb1be68ad49b1e4b2874786402c55
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Slicked Back;If you have an important event where you need to look your best (prom or a wedding for example) you should give this look a go. It doesn't matter how long your hair is or what shape your face is, you'll be able to pull this look off perfectly. It's sleek, it's sexy, and it just screams elegance.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/5b276667df0e95e97ecdb2587e33892f.jpg;5b276667df0e95e97ecdb2587e33892f
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Rough Ponytail;This is perhaps the perfect summer ponytail as it's quick, easy, and looks so stylish. All you need to do to create it is brush through your hair and then pull it all back into a rough ponytail with your fingers. Don't worry if it's not perfect, that's the whole point! If you can, try to keep you bangs hanging loose too. This is a great festival look.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/5b276667df0e95e97ecdb2587e33892f.jpg;5b276667df0e95e97ecdb2587e33892f
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/;Emma Roberts Summer;This style is incredibly stylish despite only taking a few minutes to do. All you have to do is brush your hair through, create a dramatic side parting, and sweep your hair over one shoulder. This is a fab look if you're wearing a top with a fancy back too s it really shows it off.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6d13e5e2689979cd09998aecb88fb26b.jpg;6d13e5e2689979cd09998aecb88fb26b
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Bright Dip Dye;If you're looking for a style to really make a statement then look no further! Dip dying is all the rage just now but forget about natural colours. Summer is coming which means it's time to be bold, be bright, and be free. Here Demi shows us a beautiful shade of pink but depending on your skin tone and natural hair colour you could look just as good with blue, green, purple, orange, anything! The choice is yours!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6d13e5e2689979cd09998aecb88fb26b.jpg;6d13e5e2689979cd09998aecb88fb26b
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/;TrilbyHat;Just because it's no longer cold out doesn't mean you have to stash all your hats in the attic. There are plenty of hats you can wear even now that it's summer time! Take Kristen Bell in this trilby for example, she looks fabulous and ready to take on the sun. Depending on your face shape and hairstyle I suggest you try on a number of hats to see what suits you. Oh, and try to always expose as much of your hair as possible as this will really make your look pop.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6ea6182e7efda157cc5983158b7039f9.jpg;6ea6182e7efda157cc5983158b7039f9
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Delicate Hairband;One of the biggest problems with wearing your hair down is keeping it out of your face - sound about right? If it does then why not make like Scarlett Johansson this summer and make use of a simple accessory to push your hair out of your eyes while you take in the sight of all the festivals and sandy white beaches. It's a great way to add volume to the rest of your hair as you can see too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6ea6182e7efda157cc5983158b7039f9.jpg;6ea6182e7efda157cc5983158b7039f9
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Dip Dyed Locks and a Summer Hat;Vanessa looks completely festival ready here, I'm sure you'll agree. Her purple cowboy hat looks fab with her summer outfit and helps to protect her from the sun. Make note of her lovely, natural dip dyed locks too. With her beautiful hair, cowboy hat, and sunglasses it looks as though she doesn't have a care in the world.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6edf21a8757355e9ed608e5d610bdf42.jpg;6edf21a8757355e9ed608e5d610bdf42
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Curls and Polkadots;Wearing a chic headband like Emma Roberts is a sure way to set your look alight this summer. Her polkadot headband looks fab and is a classic look that will never go out of fashion. Headbands are a great way to sweep your hair off your face while spicing up your look. No matter your hair length or face shape this is a look you ought to try!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6edf21a8757355e9ed608e5d610bdf42.jpg;6edf21a8757355e9ed608e5d610bdf42
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Messy Bun;Simply throwing your hair into a messy bun is a great summer look. It's quick, it's easy, and it allows you to pull your hair back so more of your skin can soak up the summer sun. Don't panic if you don't have long hair, as you can see Scarlett's hair isn't long either. This makes for some interesting fly aways that in my opinion only enhance the look. It's summer, not a court meeting, why would you want to worry about being perfect?;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6f3efc0761f8f2215035cae6ed878edb.jpg;6f3efc0761f8f2215035cae6ed878edb
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Pinned Back Sides;This is a great look that's truly effortless. Kirsten's delicate waves have been pinned back off her face using cute, white pins whig reveals her face and adds volume to the rest of her hair. Note how her bangs are left to fall across her face, something which helps to soften her look. The longer your hair the better for this look but of course it has many variations so don't be afraid to play around no matter your hair length.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6f3efc0761f8f2215035cae6ed878edb.jpg;6f3efc0761f8f2215035cae6ed878edb
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Braided Up Do;You may need a little help if you're thinking of trying to create a braided up do but it's completely worth the hassle. While this isn't an everyday look, this style is perfect for a formal evening somewhere. If you have a thin face try sweeping all your hair back but if you have a round face then leaving a few stands of hair down to frame it will really enhance this summer look.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7ccc7da2cf0fd6f3c3527a39baf22c11.jpg;7ccc7da2cf0fd6f3c3527a39baf22c11
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Low Sleek Ponytail;I don't know about you, but every time I try to do a normal ponytail I find myself fiddling on for ages because it keeps slipping. That's where the low ponytail comes in handy. This is a great alternative that still gets your hair out of your face without all the fuss. Plus, it really shows off the length of your hair, something I love about it. The biggest downside is that you need to have medium to long hair to pull off this style so it's a no go if you have short hair. If you're trying this style, the sleeker the better as unruly hair doesn't often work in a low ponytail.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7ccc7da2cf0fd6f3c3527a39baf22c11.jpg;7ccc7da2cf0fd6f3c3527a39baf22c11
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Natural Dip Dye;I Mentioned before about bright dip byes but don't be discouraged by the style if you don't want pink hair. There's nothing wrong with doing for a more natural tone like Rachel Bilson has done. It looks great, is still bright and summery, plus you don't need to worry about if your boss will allow it either!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7e0b494f7007a6f64a8c4a0c8bae019e.jpg;7e0b494f7007a6f64a8c4a0c8bae019e
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Extreme Side Parting and Volume;Before we move on, I think we should just take a moment to appreciate how flawless Selena Gomez looks in this picture, something I'm attributing to the great lighting, her natural beauty, and not to mention her incredible hairstyle. She's swished her long hair into an extreme side ponytail, create tonnes of volume and an asymmetrical look which makes her look chic and fearsome. No matter the length of your hair you should try brushing your hair over like this, you'll likely be surprised at the results. Plus, this style means you get to look chic as you run your hands through your hair to maintain it too!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7e0b494f7007a6f64a8c4a0c8bae019e.jpg;7e0b494f7007a6f64a8c4a0c8bae019e

It seems she's picked out the ultimate summer accessory to go with her summer up do.

http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Fluffy Bangs;Some people don't like heavy bangs but that's okay. Instead why not try this great alternative? Jen's bangs are fluffy and light, giving her the same great look without having to sacrifice the length of as much of her hair. This look is perfect for heart shaped faces.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/061d88cb56c0603e7434017095f6b85d.jpg;061d88cb56c0603e7434017095f6b85d
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Side Braid;Not sure what to do with your bangs? Pinning them back in a side braid is a great option. It looks so chic, is perfect for festivals, and it saves them from falling in your face as you swim in the sea or chill on the beach. You don't even have to worry about styling the rest of your hair either as this makes for a great boho style.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/68ed285417906bb7f29414d9be6f7abd.jpg;68ed285417906bb7f29414d9be6f7abd

http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Zig-Zag Parting;Hayden may not have the longest hair but she looks fab with her short ponytail. This look works best if you have a delicate face and you can pull all your hair back but it's worth trying even if you have a round face and bangs too.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/96c31fdda4e555629de8331dd14041a1.jpg;96c31fdda4e555629de8331dd14041a1
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Soft and Sleek;Natalie Dormer looks fab with her chic zig-zag parting. It's a great look for summer as it looks so fresh and unique. This is a style anyone can pull of no matter their face shape and even something you can add to ponytails too.

http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Half Braid;Hayden looks great with her straightened hair here. It makes her hair look so soft and is a style you can create in minutes with the right styler. No matter your face shape or hair length this is a great style, though the rounder your face the more volume you may wish to add.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/99b5e15c42ad9bbaffe5c1312571fc22.jpg;99b5e15c42ad9bbaffe5c1312571fc22
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-summer-hairstyles/; Layered Ponytail;Adding a braid down one side of your hair is a great way to pull your hair off your face and looks especially good if you style the rest of your hair too.

Enjoy!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Ashlee-Simpson.jpg;Ashlee Simpson Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;I loved Ashlee Simpson's long golden locks as I'm sure most of you did but I'm sure you can still appreciate her beautiful, sweeping pixie cut. She's opted for a long pixie cut, something which works well with her long face, and the sweeping bangs mean it's a bit more 'stylable' (yes, I'm inventing words now!). The length means she has much more freedom and isn't stuck with the same short but until it grows out.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Ashlee-Simpson.jpg;Ashlee Simpson Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;I love Emeli Sande's variation of the pixie haircut. In true Emeli style, she's shaved the sides of her hair leaving only the top of it in tact. I've seen her wearing what's left of her her in numerous different ways but this style is by far my favourite. The mountain of curls adds life to her hair and really makes her stand out in a crowd.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Emeli-Sande.jpg;Emeli Sande Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;I'll admit it, I preferred Miley's hair before. It was simply gorgeous and her flowing, brown hair made me utterly envious. That said, this new style really suits her and given her personality shift it suits her all the more. Here she's gone with an almost 'short back and sides' look and diet her hair a lovely blonde. I'd also like to point out all those gorgeous earrings she's wearing, something that definitely goes in favour of pixie cuts. You can never see my earrings because of all my hair yet here Miley's are on show for all the world to see.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Emeli-Sande.jpg;Emeli Sande Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;I absolutely adore this look on Kiera Knightley. She's so petite of face that she definitely suits short hair and here she's proving the shorter the better. She's kept her pixie cut reasonably long however yet the way it's swept to the side makes it seem shorter. I love the textured look she's given it, stopping it from looking limp. Her mix of highlights and lowlights looks amazing too, it brings a warmth to her face and makes her hair look completely natural.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0efc6bccd24e7944a85299a398ba33bd.jpg;Miley Cyrus Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Hayden is another celebrity who I was devastated to see have their haircut. She had gorgeous long locks that again I was completely envious of. That said, her new hair really suits her! She looks fantastic here with her hair styled back off her face, revealing her beauty. The great thing about the length of her pixie cut is that it's long enough for her to wear it in various styles and therefore not look the same day after day.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0efc6bccd24e7944a85299a398ba33bd.jpg;Miley Cyrus Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Since getting her pixie haircut, Carey Mulligan really seems to have come into her own. She did it way before it became stylish to do so and really owned the style. It's now become her signature look. Here she's wearing her pixie cut reasonably long which has allowed her to add light waves to the style. The gentle waves add texture and life to her hair, ensuring it doesn't look limp, and her hair has also been side swept to add a bit of extra volume.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1a8af393f76a2d97d1007417a3a364d7.jpg;Kiera Knightley Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;This style looks incredible on the former High School Musical star Vanessa Hudgens. I love how she's got her hair sweeping in two different directions, once across her face and the second time backward. It really makes for a unique look. Vanessa has also stayed true to her roots and kept her hair her natural colour, something I'd like to commend her for as we really don't see it enough these days.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1a8af393f76a2d97d1007417a3a364d7.jpg;Kiera Knightley Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Here Rihanna sports a look similar to Emile Sande's with short sides and a sweeping mount of hair atop her head. I love the way her bangs sweep across her face, directing attention to her eyes. I'd also like to commend her as I did with Vanessa for her natural colour. As you can see it really brings out her skin tone and makes her eyes pop. Going natural is definitely something you should consider if you're thinking of getting a pixie cut.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/01d19dc1bc4e598f621ec7c9dcd97684.jpg;Hayden Panettiere Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;This is by far one of my favourite pixie haircuts and I'm sure you'll love it too! Curls, who'd have thought it? Her hair has been left long enough to allow her to curl it, making way for this fantastic look. One of the best things about curls is the way they bring out your highlights too. It really helps to add a textured look to your hair. This style simply wows me!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/01d19dc1bc4e598f621ec7c9dcd97684.jpg;Hayden Panettiere Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Just because you have a pixie haircut doesn't mean you have to give up doing girly things to your hair such as adding plaits. Carey looks beautiful here having added just a few simple plaits into her otherwise natural hair. This look is unbelievably simple to create yet the effects are undeniably fantastic. I told you Carey had made the pixie cut her own, didn't I?;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2-Carey-Mulligan.jpg;Carey Mulligan Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;This is one of Miley's best looks if you ask me. Her hair has been swept over to one side, creating volume and texture, while the other side of her head has literally been left bare having been shaved. This style is chic, edgy, and really makes her look like a rockstar. Again, I'd like to point out her earrings which are fully on display, a fab pro to the pixie styles.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2-Carey-Mulligan.jpg;Carey Mulligan Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Similar to Miley's previous picture, Rihanna has her hair side swept and has had the side of her head which has been left bare shaved. Not so similar to Miley however, the part of her hair which has been swept across hasn't been combed neatly, it instead looks incredibly windswept. This look is probably not something you could wear around the office but there's no denying it's perfect for hitting the town with.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2-Vanessa-Hudgens-.jpg;Vanessa Hudgens Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;After cutting (or rather shaving) her hair for her role in Les Miserables, Anne Hathaway chose to keep her new look and rock the pixie cut. She's done it incredibly well if you ask me. Here she looks lovely with her neat hairstyle, marking her as a true beauty and a professional. I do hope to see her with her long locks again at some point but for now I love her pixie cut.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2-Vanessa-Hudgens-.jpg;Vanessa Hudgens Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Frankie Sanford has been rocking the pixie cut for way longer than most celebrities out there. This look is one of my favourites on her. She's kept her cut slightly longer than most which has enabled her to style it to one side and finish it with a gorgeous flick which really highlights her eyes. It's such a simple addition but it really changes her look.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/002bb16d118bd74e21f76ff976eec429.jpg;Rihanna Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;When Natalie Portman shaved her hair for her role in V for Vendetta I was devastated. I mean, completely and utterly in pieces. But once again I got over it as yet another celebrity showed how awesome pixie cuts truly are. Personally, I don't think enough pixie cuts are accessorised. I mean, just because your hair is short doesn't mean you have to stop wearing hats, hairbands, and all the rest, right? Here, Natalie shows just how great and how simple accessorising your new style can be.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/002bb16d118bd74e21f76ff976eec429.jpg;Rihanna Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Bold is beautiful, something which Rihanna really proved here. She's swapped the natural colour of her pixie cut for startling, fiery red which really sets her look alight. It's bold, it's unmissable, and it looks great. Well done, RiRi!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2Evan-Rachel-Wood.jpg;Evan Rachel Wood Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Anne Hathaway? Blonde? I never thought I'd see the day yet I'm so glad I did! Anne looks absolutely stunning in her new shade, especially since she's roughed her hair up a little too and stepped away from her usual prim and proper look. I can't get over how incredible she looks here. Perhaps we all ought to be a little more bold and swap our natural colour for something a little more alive. You never know what it could do for your look.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2Evan-Rachel-Wood.jpg;Evan Rachel Wood Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Okay, so I admit it. I'm still crying over Emma Watson's long, lost locks. I love her new look but if I had a magic wish I'd wish her old hair back in a heartbeat. Still, let's focus on why she looks fantastic here! She's smoothed her hair down and combed it out, pulling it to the sides to create a parting which you don't see too often in pixie cuts.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/03-Carey-Mulligan.jpg;Carey Mulligan Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Here J.Law has opted for a slightly lighter tone of colour than he usual, something which is great to see. It's just a simple change but it has had a big effect on her look. She's also smoothed her hair down nicely, making of a great professional look or, in this case, a perfect red carpet style.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/03-Carey-Mulligan.jpg;Carey Mulligan Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;This look is incredibly on J.Law and again she's wearing it on the red carpet. Her hair looks fantastic swept off her ace as it reveals her eyes, bringing out her true beauty. She's also managed to capture a great deal of texture in her hair which gives her look a little something extra if you ask me.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3d1e3222353ba418d8fa164807bed77c.jpg;Miley Cyrus Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Here our film star beauty is back to her natural colour but doesn't she look lovely for it? This is a great everyday pixie haircut style, one which is simple to create, maintain, and one which looks fab even if you just rolled out of bed. That's the great thing about pixie cuts, they're quick and easy to style, not a faff like if you have long hair.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3d1e3222353ba418d8fa164807bed77c.jpg;Miley Cyrus Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;This picture shows Emma with her pixie cut at it's best if you ask me. This slightly grown out style really suits her. She's combed it back, making it look neat and also showing off its length. The cut of it means you can see hair which is usually hidden too, showing off Emma's natural highlights. The star looks fantastic here, so elegant and chic.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/04ec385a68e6fc3b24d3f63e6a8f48bc.jpg;Rihanna Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Here's another great look for J.Law. She's simply taken a bit of gel or hair putty and styled her hair like most guys do. Sounds simple? Well, that's because it is but my she looks fantastic for it! This style really brings her hair to life and adds volume, texture, and even makes her look a bit edgy. She truly is rocking the pixie cut!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/04ec385a68e6fc3b24d3f63e6a8f48bc.jpg;Rihanna Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;I suppose this is about the longest your hair can be before you have to start calling it a pixie haircut. This is one of Emma Watson's best looks if you ask me. She's had her hair swept in all directions, giving it lots of texture, and the longer length of it frames her face perfectly. It really shows off her delicate features while still making her look like a rock chick.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7d7357b87ed9e1693f1f11bde6f05e96.jpg;Anne Hathaway Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Again Rihanna's back with her pixie haircut with shaved sides but this time she's done it with a twist. She's stuck with her natural black colour however has added some distinct blonde highlights to liven up her look. She looks incredibly beautiful here, as well as quirky, edgy, sharp, and like a style goddess. Is there any look she can't pull off? I'm beginning to think probably not!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7d7357b87ed9e1693f1f11bde6f05e96.jpg;Anne Hathaway Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Here Jen has opted for quite a natural look and one which requires minimal styling. This style proves why pixie cuts are so great: they're so easy to maintain and styling them doesn't even require styling them. They look great all on their own. She has her hair slightly shaved/shorter at the back to really bring out the edge in her look but the longer parts of her hair are just left to flow freely, ending in a beautiful result.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7ddaf174020fe343b4b011db07d6ddf8.jpg;Frankie Sandford Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Keira is another star that really suits the long pixie look. She's straightened her hair, making it look incredibly fine, however this doesn't spoil her look. In fact it only serve to enhance her delicate features. She's arranged her hair beautifully around her face to frame it and added slight flicks in the ends of her hair for a little extra style. I'm failing to see a downside to this look. It really suits her.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7ddaf174020fe343b4b011db07d6ddf8.jpg;Frankie Sandford Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Here Miley starts to show off her truly individual style which is often questionable. Well, often questionable, not in this picture however. I never thought a spiked, slightly mohican hairstyle could work on a girl yet Miley has pulled it off flawlessly. The fact that she's died the spiked her a contesting colour to the rest of her hair really makes it stand out. If you're feeling really brave, then this may be the style for you. It sure looks fab!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8a3eca8a49bf2e8a09d32dd47b5d8d63.jpg;Natalie Portman Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Carey Mulligan is on fire with this fantastic haircut. The way her hair has been styled makes it look alive and it's filled with texture. The addition of a twisted piece of hair really enhances the style, completely changing it despite how simple it is to do. This style is quick, easy, yet wields fantastic results.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8a3eca8a49bf2e8a09d32dd47b5d8d63.jpg;Natalie Portman Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;This is another short and simple style which can be worn everyday with minimal effort. It looks great whether you're heading for a night out, going grocery shopping, going to work, or sitting on a talk show like Natalie here. I wasn't sure at first, but she's definitely pulled off the pixie style.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8b9c81470ba2d985437a217afdd6b540.jpg;Rihanna Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Charlize looks fantastic here as her short pixie cut shows off her delicate features. The way her hair gently waves back is superb. I love how it rises and falls, giving her look volume, texture, and showing off all the subtle colour differences in her hair all at once. This style is a real winner and one I'm surprised we don't see a lot more of.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8b9c81470ba2d985437a217afdd6b540.jpg;Rihanna Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Coco looks amazing here with her styled and sleek look. I love how she's added a parting to her hair, soothing I already mentioned we don't see often with pixie cuts, and then slicked all her hair to the sides. She's paired this looks with absolutely stunning makeup which makes her look chic, elegant, and like an absolute angel.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/9f0056476e6c24572bab688970d42a1f.jpg;Anne Hathaway Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;If you weren't a fan of the slicked back look Coco was going for in the previous picture then it's likely you'll like this picture better. She's gone for a similar style just without all the slick, making for a more natural look. This allows her hair to rise and fall naturally, bringing volume to her look. Her hair looks lovely and fluffy, I'd love to know what she styled it with, I could certainly do with some.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/9f0056476e6c24572bab688970d42a1f.jpg;Anne Hathaway Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;The Minogue sisters always look beautiful. Fact. Even with her pixie haircut Dannii is no exception to this rule. Here she's gone for a simple side swept style which curves her bangs gently around her face. While this isn't my favourite look on her, she still looks incredible as I'm sure she will for many years to come.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/47f26d6c767a851cb1295d43e779abb4.jpg;Emma Watson Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;This is one of my absolute favourite Natalie Portman looks! Believe it or not, she's still wearing the pixie cut we saw earlier but she's somehow managed to bundle it back and pin it behind her head, making it look much longer than it actually is.  As you can see, a lot of her hair has been left loose atop her head and simply pinned in place by hairspray which is the secret to this look. Wow, simply wow!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/47f26d6c767a851cb1295d43e779abb4.jpg;Emma Watson Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Here's yet another celebrity proving that you can still accessorise even with a pixie haircut. This is so simple yet it completely changes your look. All Evan has done is slid a hatband into her hair, pushed her hair back, and voila! She looks so different to the star we saw earlier yet it's still the same haircut. Amazing!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/184dd520f04d81c2dc4598490559f069.jpg;Jennifer Lawrence Pixie Cut

The key is to go with a natural colour that you know will suit you and keep your hair well groomed.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/184dd520f04d81c2dc4598490559f069.jpg;Jennifer Lawrence Pixie Cut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;I absolutely adore Frankie's hair! She was one of the first celebrities to really rock having one side of hair longer than the other and in my opinion it was her that kickstarted the who pixie cut trend. This is great as it gives her hair volume, texture, truly bring out her highlights, and frames her face beautifully without falling over it.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/412d6a3e70fb2c3c5fead461e905f2e9.jpg;Jennifer Lawrence Pixie Haircut

It's amazing how such a simple change can totally transform your look. Frankie looks so elegant here, perhaps even like a stylish nineteen twenties woman if that makes sense!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/412d6a3e70fb2c3c5fead461e905f2e9.jpg;Jennifer Lawrence Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;While the majority of Halle's hair is really short here, she's kept a few strands longer which has allowed her to create this fabulous look. She's gently teased her hair into various positions, really bringing her look to life and adding a deal of texture and volume to her style. I don't think many women suit hair this short but Halle certainly pulls it off.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/462f76a2340d6f28c8ef071f4105051a.jpg;Anne Hathaway Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Here's Halle again wearing a similar style. The major difference however is the colour of her hair. She's had the tips of her hair highlighted a lovely caramel colour which sits in stark contrast with her naturally dark hair. This contrast really catches the eye but still she's gone easy on the change and hasn't overdone it I'm pleased to say.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/462f76a2340d6f28c8ef071f4105051a.jpg;Anne Hathaway Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Not enough women with pixie cuts wear hats if you ask me. Why this is the case remains a mystery however as Isabel proves just how great the style works. Provided you leave some of your hair on show and choose a hat that works with your outfit, there's no reason that this style won't work. Try it, you'll see!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1042d17615c31c34dc8d88a0cb518432.jpg;Emma Watson Pixie Haircut

Her hair doesn't seem to know what direction it's going in but yet it works. Pixie styles are perhaps one of the only styles this works for so I'm pleased Michelle is taking advantage of that fact.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1042d17615c31c34dc8d88a0cb518432.jpg;Emma Watson Pixie Haircut

I'll admit, I preferred her look in the previous photo but if you're heading somewhere important then I suppose this should be your go to style. It's simple, it's sweet, and it's professional.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7264c98b129889df531e3963f93e484b.jpg;Jennifer Lawrence Pixie Haircut

Being P!nk, it's unlikely we'll see her looking prim and proper any time soon but we don't mind, not when she pulls off this messy pixie style so well. This style is fab and it really suits her personality and her music.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7264c98b129889df531e3963f93e484b.jpg;Jennifer Lawrence Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;Here's Pixie sporting a style that perfectly matches her name! She's said no to the natural look and has absorbed a gorgeous pink style. She's chosen her colour carefully, making it not too bright to be inappropriate but bright enough to make a statement. I love it! This washed out shade is great if you're thinking of dying your hair any colour.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/9941f518c222aaad8ae910fb58015aa0.jpg;Emma Watson Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;This pixie haircut is absolutely fabulous! Sarah's gently waves completely transform an everyday pixie cut into something truly special. Notice that they're not too tightly woven and not too loose either. It's the fact that her waves are perfect that really makes this style work. I also love her side swept bangs which slightly touch over one eye but not enough to obscure it.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/9941f518c222aaad8ae910fb58015aa0.jpg;Emma Watson Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;In contrast, here Sarah has her hair completely straight yet still beautifully styled. She's puffed it up at the back to add heaps of volume and swept her bangs off in a totally different direction, making for a unique and beautiful style.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/30143c525d8bb7c6af8a13620ee0f958.jpg;Rihanna Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-pixie-haircut/;;When she starred in the Following, no one could get over how fantastic Valorie Curry's pixie haircut was, even if she was playing a murderous character. Her style is so simple yet it works. For the most part, she pulls this off so well because of her incredibly slight frame and delicate features. Her pixie cut helps to show off the rest of her fab body and highlights all her best features. Sure, she looks great with longer hair too but in my opinion it hides away some of her natural beauty.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/30143c525d8bb7c6af8a13620ee0f958.jpg;Rihanna Pixie Haircut
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;To stop her curls from potentially looking boring, Posh Spice has spiced things up a bit by curling her A Line haircut. Her cut was short in the first place but the tight curls raises it again. This is a great way to gently frame your face and add some variety to your A line style. Notice how Posh hasn't done her curls too tight either. They're just tight enough to be considered curls (though I'd say they're more waves really), giving her style a soft edge.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1ea0c86efb8c7a01e748d6179f2db937.jpg;1ea0c86efb8c7a01e748d6179f2db937
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Speaking of curls, I absolutely love pop princess Rihanna's curly A line cut. Her original A line cut sat just atop her shoulders but the tight curls she's added really picks it up, totally changing her look. Notice how the top half of her hair remains smooth and sleek and it's just the bottom half that she's had tightly curled. This is a fab way to get the best of both worlds. This style is classy, elegant, yet utterly sexy. It's one of my favourite looks on her.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1ea0c86efb8c7a01e748d6179f2db937.jpg;1ea0c86efb8c7a01e748d6179f2db937
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Rachel McAdams is a true beauty even at the worst of times but I'm sure you'll agree that her gorgeous pink A line haircut really adds to her look. Here she's taken a simple A Line cut, made it look rugged yet chic, and tinted it with some beautiful shades of pink. The soft tones really suit her pale skin while the dark tones ignite her hair colour. This is a style you can do with any colour too be it blue, red, purple, anything! Just be sure you remember to mix dark and light shades for the best effect.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2f519a2c84b960ab898209e192d76bab.jpg;2f519a2c84b960ab898209e192d76bab
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;I loved having a A line haircut but one of my biggest issues with it was that it was always in my face. I just couldn't seem to find a way to pin it back elegantly or without looking like I was four. Scarlett Johansson however has managed the feat wonderfully. She's curled one half of her hair away from her face so it doesn't fall in her way while she's pinned back the other half, making for an incredibly chic look. This is a great way to show off all your beautiful features while still having gorgeous hair.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2f519a2c84b960ab898209e192d76bab.jpg;2f519a2c84b960ab898209e192d76bab
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Of course, an A line haircut doesn't have to be anything fancy. It can beautifully simple like Nicole Ritchie here. Her smooth, sleek look shows off the fabulous definition in her style and also really shows off her highlights. I love her short, side-swept bangs. They're a great way to frame a face, especially if you have an overly large or overly short forehead.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3b5a1ef668c0d9cf25b7665326527a24.jpg;3b5a1ef668c0d9cf25b7665326527a24
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Here the pop sensation has opted for a shorter version of the A line haircut. As she's tucked under the front portion of her hair it's difficult to tell whether this is an A line style or not meaning she's found a great way to quickly alter her entire look. This cut is so simple. It's short, sweet, and sleek. No confusing bangs or layers, just style.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3b5a1ef668c0d9cf25b7665326527a24.jpg;3b5a1ef668c0d9cf25b7665326527a24
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Here Drew Barrymore has opted for a longer version of the A line haircut and has paired it with beautiful, rugged beach waves. The waves add volume to her fine hair and soften what can often be quite a sharp look. I simply love her gorgeous low lights and the way the contrasting light and dark tones bring out her skin tone.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/03b04384c76df513828af57826875908.jpg;03b04384c76df513828af57826875908
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;As I've already shown, your simple A line style need not look the same day in and day out but, for those of you with little to no time to style your hair, grabbing the curlers isn't the only option you've got. Simply adding a hat can completely change your look, giving you a chic new style that will never go out of fashion.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/03b04384c76df513828af57826875908.jpg;03b04384c76df513828af57826875908
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Here Hayden has completely transformed her look, so much so it's hard to even tell she had an A line cut to begin with. She's simply brushed all her hair back and held it in place, leaving only her long bangs to softly fly free. This style scream elegance and turns her from a woman into a proper lady. It really suits her in my opinion!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3eece7fc76ffaadb5755adf2f918892e.jpg;3eece7fc76ffaadb5755adf2f918892e
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;I love Selena Gomez's long hair but personally I think this suits her even better. It makes her look like someone you'd take seriously, not just a Wizard from Waverly Place. Note how it hangs just above her shoulders, sweeping to one side, and still looks full of volume despite being straightened. I think it's also worth noting her incredibly subtle highlights. All too often people go over the top with colour but here Selena has show that that's not at all necessary. Simple and sweet.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/3eece7fc76ffaadb5755adf2f918892e.jpg;3eece7fc76ffaadb5755adf2f918892e
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;I'm a massive fan of Nina Dobrev and her fabulous long hair yet I've fallen in love with this style on her. Okay, so I admit it, it's not a true A line cut, her long hair has only been curled and styled to look like one, but it still looks amazing. For those of you with long hair not sure if you want to get the chop or not, this is a great first step to see if the style suits you or not. Or it's just a great way to change your hair for a special occasion!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4a7bb872833d3adccc9a6161d74784d5.jpg;4a7bb872833d3adccc9a6161d74784d5
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Okay, so I'll admit that I'm not totally sold on this look but I know some people who love it. Here Drew has altered her straight cut style by adding tight curls, each of them well defined. It makes her style seem a good couple of inches charter and adds a lot of volume to her hair. Perhaps if you're going to a seventies party…;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4a7bb872833d3adccc9a6161d74784d5.jpg;4a7bb872833d3adccc9a6161d74784d5
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;For the majority of A line styles hair is flicked under at the bottom, creating a bobbed look. Here Scarlett has broken from that tradition to make a great look all of her own. She's has the tips of her hair flicked out the other way making for a whole new look, one I'm not even sure how to describe. This is fab as it looks great yet requires minimal styling.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/5a7f76fecf08e48a60c4f40edcc4960b.jpg;5a7f76fecf08e48a60c4f40edcc4960b
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;This is by far one of my favourite looks on good old Gwen. It really suits her slim figure and brings out the structure in her face. This medium length is fab as it allows her to show off her shoulders and back while taking nothing away from her face. As usual, she wears her hair smooth and sleek, a style which she seems to know suits her best.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/5a7f76fecf08e48a60c4f40edcc4960b.jpg;5a7f76fecf08e48a60c4f40edcc4960b
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;This is another style of Drew's that seems to have torn opinions but personally I love it. I wish this was my hair! Her soft curls add tonnes of volume to her hair and even makes it look layered when it's not. She's swept her hair off her face, bringing out all her beautiful features and giving herself an elegance I don't think we've seen in her other styles. Fabulous! I love it!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7a5105c3a310a0c0f34d2d265b9ab8a1.jpg;7a5105c3a310a0c0f34d2d265b9ab8a1
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;This it seems is much more like the Victoria Beckham we're all used to. Short, straight and sharp. This style really suits her as it highlights her angular face instead of risking hiding it away. Plus, the shape manages to give her a slight bit of volume despite her seemingly thin hair. The soft tones really bring out her tanned skin too. All in all, I'm struggling to think of why this doesn't work.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7a5105c3a310a0c0f34d2d265b9ab8a1.jpg;7a5105c3a310a0c0f34d2d265b9ab8a1

I love that it's not just straight and plain like so many other A Line styles. The slight flicks and waves really liven up the style and add a bit of personality to Bethany's look. It's a winner if you ask me.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/7fe31c11483e8456ce859557e512d0a1.jpg;7fe31c11483e8456ce859557e512d0a1

While it looks fab long, I'm sure you'll agree this short A line style really suits her.

Either way it looks fab!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8f83384096f83f247695caa1d76ebd15.jpg;8f83384096f83f247695caa1d76ebd15
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Kiera Knightley is one of those women who looks fab no matter how she does this hair but it seems she favours short looks. This look is perfect for her. The A line style is cut to just below her chin meaning it can easily tuck under, framing her face like few other cuts can, helping to show off all her delicate features. This is a real winner for her if you ask me.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/8f83384096f83f247695caa1d76ebd15.jpg;8f83384096f83f247695caa1d76ebd15

http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;For those of you wondering what Scarlett's hair looked like before she had it swept back, this is your answer. An A line style with perfect, soft curls. The curls really add volume to her hair, lovingly showing off her round face, and I'm sure you'll agree that the red really sets of her look. It brings a warmth to her skin and really shows off the green in her eyes. If you're looking for a new style for summer, this should definitely be in your top ten!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/28fd7eaa7c80a94200f5ab1c5074afad.jpg;28fd7eaa7c80a94200f5ab1c5074afad
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Hayden looked fab before where I showed her with her hair pinned back off her face but I think I prefer her usual A line style even more. It's simple, it's sleek, and it's the perfect length to show off her face and her prominent collar bones. The lack of layers means her hair is full of volume without looking rugged. It's just elegant, sleek, and simple.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/28fd7eaa7c80a94200f5ab1c5074afad.jpg;28fd7eaa7c80a94200f5ab1c5074afad

It's perhaps the most simple A line style you can get, though I warn you it doesn't come with many styling options. I think she looks fab with one side of hair swept off her face and tucked behind her ear and with the other side hanging loose. You can't really call it a style but boy it suits her!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/71c4933e300ee447ef90ed02b6b76ee8.jpg;71c4933e300ee447ef90ed02b6b76ee8

Sure, it doesn't look natural on her but when you look that good who on Earth cares? Her long A line style looks incredible on her and suddenly makes her look like a grown up compared to her the Vampire Diaries character, Bonnie. Perhaps a dramatic change of colour is what we all need…;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/72c2e809a41e4037bd696e030f66dbfb.jpg;72c2e809a41e4037bd696e030f66dbfb

This however is by far my favourite. This medium length style transforms her, making her look like a business women and someone you wouldn't want to mrs with. It's also incredibly sexy too. Mixed with her husky, sultry voice, I'd say Sophia is on to a definite winner.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/73b31c877a8967fb36841c388cf87e2a.jpg;73b31c877a8967fb36841c388cf87e2a

Her hair is naturally fine however having roughed it up a bit she seems to have a bit more life now. The subtle side sweep of her parting is something else I love; it's not quite central yet it's not so far over that it risks hair falling in her face. Again she's got her hair at that beautiful length where it nicely curls under her chin.";http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/085e19c48b855754e6c0550e1581bef9.jpg;085e19c48b855754e6c0550e1581bef9

This style screams elegance to me - it would be perfect for a wedding, a prom, or something along those lines.

http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Yes, believe it or not these was a time before Miley chopped off her hair and decided to develop her wild personally. This is by far my favourite look for the young star and shows her with an elegance we don't often get to see. Her soft curls scream nineteen-twenties at me and paired with her perfect makeup I don't see how anyone could possibly go wrong with this look. Here's hoping we get to see Miley looking a little more like this again in future. She sure looks beautiful here.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0201c594838436105ae64c0d7f9c1584.jpg;0201c594838436105ae64c0d7f9c1584
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Here Christina sports a rare blend of both curls and waves, something we don't see often enough if you ask me. This style makes her look chic yet still totally care free. This look is perfect whether you're simply hitting the town for a night out, going for a shopping trip, or simply lounging around the house. This is what I call an 'anytime' style as it suits most any occasion.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/0201c594838436105ae64c0d7f9c1584.jpg;0201c594838436105ae64c0d7f9c1584
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Okay, okay, so I've mention Scarlett loads already, I know. But the thing is she rocks A Line styles like few other people can. She's sown off so many over the years, making them all look flawless. Here is another favourite of mine where she sports simple rugged waves. Sure, she's not perfectly preened but coupled with her lovely makeup she pulls off this style and turns a rugged look into something very stylish. That's quite an accomplishment if you ask me.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/470a0fcd24d059fce030d0b62fe759ae.jpg;470a0fcd24d059fce030d0b62fe759ae
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;This look is sheer genius if you ask me. In fact, I wish this was my hair! Dianna has taken a simple A line cut and styled it so it looks completely fresh and new. She's mixed a variety of brush strokes and used a straightener to both straighten and flick her hair, truly giving it a life of its own. This look is incredibly sexy yet still looks professional and everyday too. It's incredibly versatile and looks fab on all face shapes.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/470a0fcd24d059fce030d0b62fe759ae.jpg;470a0fcd24d059fce030d0b62fe759ae
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;While we're on the subject of Dianna Agron's rugged looks, here's another of them. I'll admit I don't like this look quite as much yet there's still a certain charm to it. My one tip if you're trying out this look is to maybe use a smoothing setup afterward to minimise any flyways, that way you'll still get the rugged look but maybe not quite so…well, rugged.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/736f3e0cfe70eb564c3388dec0ca6e1c.jpg;736f3e0cfe70eb564c3388dec0ca6e1c
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;This is perhaps the Dianna we're all used to seeing. She looks much more like her Glee character here. I love how she's not tucked under her ends but has instead flicked them out, something which I think really brings her look to like. She still looks smart and chic yet she has a bit of personality about her now too. Her side swept bangs also look fabulous here. They add both mystery and innocence to her look, something I didn't even think was possible until I saw this picture.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/736f3e0cfe70eb564c3388dec0ca6e1c.jpg;736f3e0cfe70eb564c3388dec0ca6e1c
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Okay, I'll stop with Dianna after this one I promise but I just wanted to clearly show how one person can wear one style yet change it so completely. Here she completely transforms her look once again and the addition of large, soft curls makes her look smart and elegant opposed to innocent and sexy as we've seen her look before. Her distinct, side parting looks great and really helps to add volume to her hair and change up her look too. You'll be amazed by just how much moving your parting can change your look. Seriously, you should try it!;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/787f6a10def64b06407ca5ca7a81b826.jpg;787f6a10def64b06407ca5ca7a81b826
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Here Kirsten has opted for a shorter look than we saw earlier, and she's also added in a full fringe which personally I don't think we see enough of these days. Her hair is styled simply with the addition of just light waves which bring life to her hair and ensures her fine hair doesn't look limp. This is an incredibly simple look and is a great way to ensure you still look fabulous even if you don't have much time to style yourself.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/787f6a10def64b06407ca5ca7a81b826.jpg;787f6a10def64b06407ca5ca7a81b826

If you're thinking of trying an A line style but don't want to make too big a commitment then this may be the style for you.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4306d479887d3f81bcfc94a8fdb8ccce.jpg;4306d479887d3f81bcfc94a8fdb8ccce

This style is elegant, sharp, stylish, and very professional, a great option if you need to be taken seriously, perhaps at a new job. One of my favourite things about this style is how low maintenance it is too. Simply brush it through, perhaps take a minute to straighten it, and you're done. Quick and easy.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4306d479887d3f81bcfc94a8fdb8ccce.jpg;4306d479887d3f81bcfc94a8fdb8ccce
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Here Emma Roberts sports a long version of the A line haircut. It would in fact look longer again were it not for the gentle curls she has running through it. Emma has quite fine hair so the curls helps to bring a bit of volume to it and not make it look limp. This is a great trick for those of you who aren't blessed with naturally thick hair. This look is great if you've got highlights to as the curls really help to bring them to light.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4841d11effcecd692cd9e2cfee81adba.jpg;4841d11effcecd692cd9e2cfee81adba

All you need to do is brush it through and you look fab again.";http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/4841d11effcecd692cd9e2cfee81adba.jpg;4841d11effcecd692cd9e2cfee81adba
http://www.herinterest.com/50-best-a-line-haircut/;;Having an A line style that's longer at one side than it is at the other isn't something everyone can pull of yet Rihanna does it flawlessly. She's totally rocking this uneven look, making the style her own. Having this style straight really shows off your look and doesn't hide the varying lengths either. This is a great style if you're bold enough to try it.;http://www.herinterest.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/6177b5acda3644759edda26b8132dbd5.jpg;6177b5acda3644759edda26b8132dbd5
