http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Golden Tips;Gold is one of the most widely used colors on female hair, but not everyone knows how to use it to create a perfect look.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Strawberry Blonde;Strawberry blonde is one of the best hair colors that a lady can wear especially those with very long locks as they will help showcase the color much better. The contrast created between the blonde locks and the strawberry highlights make this style a must try. However, you should go moderate with the strawberry because if you make it to dominant on the hair, it will ruin the look.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Strawberry-Blonde-500x500.jpg;Strawberry Blonde;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA9DjGYLGJf/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Warm Colors for Short Hairs;If you only have a couple of inches on your head, then warm colors will be perfect for you.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Golden Honey Brown;Some colors will make you look good, but others will make you look exquisite like the golden honey brown.

It is a perfect idea for medium and longer hair strands.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Golden-Honey-Brown-500x500.jpg;Golden Honey Brown;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA85_uFCzes/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Soft Painting;Ladies with short locks also have plenty of options to choose from when painting their hairs. However, with this length, you should keep things simple and soft as it looks more elegant this way. The strands are colored in an ombre design but since the haircut is layered the locks below are dark with polished tips. For short hair, you should concentrate on the ends since they will be more visible.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Soft-Painting-500x500.jpg;Soft Painting;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA85l-kE8eu/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Multi-Tonal Blowdry;It will probably take you way much longer to get this balayage style than most others, but the final results are worth every minute you spend on it. The hair is a permanent blow-dry, and it already looks incredible this way, but the addition of different shades makes it, even more, amazing. However, you should use colors and shades that blend in together to avoid an awkward look.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Multi-tonal-Blowdry-500x500.jpg;Multi-tonal Blowdry;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA84qc3mT6O/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Dark Colors Perfection;When most ladies think about dyeing their hairs what comes to their mind is bright pastel shades. Although bright colors look amazing, dark ones are just as attractive if not more appealing. Just like with other styles, you have to choose the right shade or those that go well together if you want to have more than one. A blend of dark black and brown works well for most ladies like this style, and you can use them on any hair size and type.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dark-Colors-Perfection-500x500.jpg;Dark Colors Perfection;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA84nl_mT6H/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Balayage Locks;Some locks will require no styling at all after coloring, and you only need to push them back to finish the look. These locks are a perfect example of a style where the colors do all the magic. The strands are dark brown at the roots and are finished with polished blonde tips to create a look that you will want to keep for a long time. However, this look will only beÂ incredible with a very long hair.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Balayage-Locks-500x500.jpg;Balayage Locks;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA837Wrtmyw/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Beach Waves;Beach Waves are popular hairdos for ladies with shorter locks, but you can enhance this look with some dying. Just like any other style the choice of shades to use and how to apply them also matters a lot. The hair is painted with a profound and dark color at the top, and it is finished with some blonde highlights.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Beach-Waves-500x500.jpg;Beach Waves;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA83b4egbnn/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Subtle Colored;What makes this style special is that the hair color is accentuated with a layered color that matches the natural hair look. The brown highlights help to contrast the shade from the natural hair color to create an interesting play between the different shades in the locks.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Subtle-Colored-500x500.jpg;Subtle Colored;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA83gSrv7kw/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Blowout Ombre;The blowout ombre demonstrates well just how versatile the balayage hair can be. Here long blowout locks are maintained, but the coloring is what makes them an eye-catching style. Apart from the natural hair look, only one other shade is used.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Fundamental Highlights;If you have a beautiful natural hair, you will not have to do any painting at all to wear a balayage look. Natural highlights make an incredible look, especially if the hair is healthy and kept neat like in this style. The only time that the wearer has to do any coloring on her strands is when she wants to wear a different color or enhance the appearance of the natural highlights.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Fundamental-Highlights-500x500.jpg;Fundamental Highlights;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8zHprtcdM/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Shadowed Roots;Darkening the hair roots not only helps to create a natural ombre, but it also opens up the hair for the creation of any color design that you wish. Although just shadowing roots is enough to create a gorgeous look going further and working on the rest of the strands will give you an, even more, attractive look. A good example is in this style where the strands are given a soft touch to create baby lights, and there is also a hint of lilac in the style.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shadowed-Roots-500x500.jpg;Shadowed Roots;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8wDv-rnC2/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Goldilocks Transition;The best hair dyes are created by a change from one style or color to another.

The curls at the end of the locks also create a fabulous look that you can wear for a long time without growing tired of it.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Goldilocks-Transition-500x500.jpg;Goldilocks Transition;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8t2szBpsm/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;The Ice Queen;The Ice Queen hairdo comes from beach waves that get a creative dye job. Although the light shade of blonde is the most dominant color or what is most visible, there are a couple of other colors involved in creating the looks. The roots have a shadow, and there are also some moderate gold highlights on the locks. Add all these incredible styles to the curly ends and you have a fantastic look fit for a real ice queen.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Ice-Queen-500x500.jpg;The Ice Queen;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8s0hMMF9j/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Lovely Flat Strands;Combining different shades always creates an incredible hairdo like in this flat ironed push back hair. The coloring of the hair is done using various shades of brown and blonde. Although the choice of shades is spot on the application also contributes significantly to the beauty of the style.

When wearing a dye, you should not only get the colors right but should also apply them keenly and creatively.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lovely-Flat-Strands-500x500.jpg;Lovely Flat Strands;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8r5W7h6AK/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Lightened Balayage;Balayage is a very versatile technique of adding some color to the hair but it is not always just about dying as there other ways to achieve a different hair color. One of the other ways is lightening using different products. If you have blonde hair lightening will make the locks look brighter than normal, and you can use this technique to create highlights by applying the product on a few strands while leaving the rest in their natural color.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lightened-Balayage-500x500.jpg;Lightened Balayage;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8rlYrMC7G/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Purple Magic;Bright colors make perfect hairstyles but not everyone is bold enough to wear them, but there is a solution to enjoy the beauty while still maintaining a simple style. You can color a few locks purple to create amazing highlights on your dark hairs. However, you should do it creatively so that the purple shade can blend in with the rest of the locks and not appear like a foreign addition to your head.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Purple-Magic-500x500.jpg;Purple Magic;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8rfgmh6Pa/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Silver Cuts;A pair of shears can create a fantastic hairstyle especially if they are in the hands of a skilled stylist, and there is enough hair volume and length. After doing some excellent cuts on the locks, you should not stop there as you can make your look, even more, fabulous with some lovely color. Instead of going for the widely used shades you can accentuate your nicely cut hair with a unique silver shading.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Silver-Cuts-500x500.jpg;Silver Cuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8rggGOy6I/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Textured Brown Makeover;This is another example of a nicely trimmed hair to create an incredible texture. After the perfect texture is created the naturally brown hair is given some highlights to finish the look. The dyeing is as perfect as the cuts, and you can see some blonde highlights at the front and others peeking through from the bottom of the locks.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Textured-Brown-Makeover-500x500.jpg;Textured Brown Makeover;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8q-CqMBtz/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Trendy Curled Balayage;After spending a lot of time choosing the right color and dying your hair it is only fair to want it to be as visible as possible. Hair is more visible when curled, and so it is a good idea to curl your locks when finishing. Curled hair turns some strands inside out and hence bringing more color to the surface meaning that the curls will make your strands appear like they have more color than they actually do.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Trendy-Curled-Balayage-500x500.jpg;Trendy Curled Balayage;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8qd-TFPxf/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Face Framing Highlights;It's amazing how you can do so many things with hair color provided you are creative enough. Face framing hairstyles are some of the most popular with ladies that prefer to keep long locks. However since some strands will be covering your forehead, it is important to give them a perfect color combination with some highlights. If you have dark hair, some shades of blonde or brown will work correctly for you.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Face-Framing-Highlights-500x500.jpg;Face Framing Highlights;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8pQKrlP_m/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Sun Kissed Elegance;This style is a perfect example of a dyedÂ hair done properly and naturally without any foils or caps. The color choice is excellent as the different shades blend in perfectly to create some uniformity that can only be matched by a natural hair look. What makes it look elegant is that the strands are darker at the roots and brighter at the tips and hence creating a true sun-kissed appearance.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sun-Kissed-Elegance-500x500.jpg;Sun Kissed Elegance;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8n5x4jNxh/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Exquisite Platinum Hair Shading;There are some colors that very few women are bold enough to experiment with because most are not sure how they would look in them. However, these colors make some of the best hair shades if used well. An example of such a color is platinum that can be worn as highlights or if you are bold enough go all platinum with your hair like in this particular hairdo.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Exquisite-Platinum-Hair-Shading-500x500.jpg;Exquisite Platinum Hair Shading;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8k35-R3Bw/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Stunning Soft Roots;Although this hairstyle has some very healthy locks and right color choice what makes it stand out is how the colors are used on the strands. The fine root color melts in perfectly into a cool blonde, and the transition from one to the other is so gradual, and you would hardly notice the boundary in the hair between the color levels.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stunning-Soft-Roots-419x500.jpg;Stunning Soft Roots;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8ktXoERLs/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Plain and Simple;Many ladies know that the best styles come from not overdoing things or by keeping them as simple as possible. The same also applies to hair dyeing because even a simple dark and light brown combination like in this style can create a classy look. All that you should do in this style is to create two different shades of the same color and some curls at the tips to create an exquisite style that any woman will love to wear.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Plain-and-Simple-500x500.jpg;Plain and Simple;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8kBktHbm7/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Smooth Chunky;Smooth chunky is a type of balayage that brings together various shades to create a fantastic contrast. Although this hairdo uses different colors, it is advisable not to overdo the contrast as this will change how the style looks. In here, smooth chunky starts with some nicely done root shade that transitions into a lightened blonde. A mid-tone copper transition color that only covers about an inch separates the two levels of colors.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Smooth-Chunky-500x500.jpg;Smooth Chunky;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8kAYwjeBO/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;The Long layers;Long layers will always make a great hairdo especially if they are trimmed by a pro but the only shortcoming with this style is that they look very plain when done on natural hair color. However, you can easily overcome this with some nice dye job. To make sure that the layers are still visible the hair uses only dark highlights with the most dominant color being the dark brown that blends in perfectly with natural hue.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Long-layers-400x500.jpg;The Long layers;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8jerWLnhF/

http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Textured and Smokey;Adding some texture to your long locks will always make you look gorgeous. However, texture also enhances the look if you use some color on your locks and so the two go well together. Although the textured hair is good with hair dyes, it looks particularly fantastic with certain ones such as the smokey blonde in this hairdo with some traces of gray highlights.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Textured-and-Smokey-500x500.jpg;Textured and Smokey;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8iBzMse7C/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Bright and Long Summer Blonde;These strands have a very widely used balayage color, but there are a few other characteristics that make this an incredible hairdo. The length of the hair and the brightness of the shade are the two things that make this style stand out. If you have strands that stretch all the way to the waistline like in this hair, then this is a good idea for your locks. To make the hair this bright you only need to use an enlightening product.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bright-and-Long-Summer-Blonde-500x500.jpg;Bright and Long Summer Blonde;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA8hkHEAgIj/

http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Dark Balayage;Bright colors appear more attractive because the human eye easily notices these shades, but dark ones also make perfect hairdos if you combine them well. In this style the base color is black, and the strands have a very deep shade at the roots. However, as you move away from the roots the locks drastically transition to a dark brown shade.Â ;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dark-Balayage-500x500.jpg;Dark Balayage;https://www.instagram.com/p/-NALNyye8b/

http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Redhead Elegance;Red based balayage styles are some of the most attractive especially if you have an excellent formula for combining different shades. In this hairstyle, the base is formed by copper which is also the most dominant color. The shades get lighter towards the tips, and there are a few amber lights to spice up the looks.Â ;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Redhead-Elegance-500x500.jpg;Redhead Elegance;https://www.instagram.com/p/8WSKGzye2p/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Long Dark Brown Waves;The base color for this hair is dark brown, and it has a fantastic light brown balayage coloring. This is a perfect color choice because the two shades blend in perfectly to create a more natural look that you can wear for months without needing to change or redo the dye.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Long-Dark-Brown-Waves-500x500.jpg;Long Dark Brown Waves;https://www.instagram.com/p/7qpfaQye9o/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Platinum and Ash Blonde Blend;This is probably the coolest combination you can ever wish for, and it is suitable for most people regardless of whether you like bright or dark shades. The hairs start with a dark shadow at the roots and unlike what you would expect in other hairdos the transition as you move lower down the strands does not eliminate the dark shades. It is made more elegant by the fact that the strands are wavy.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Platinum-and-Ash-Blonde-Blend-500x500.jpg;Platinum and Ash Blonde Blend;https://www.instagram.com/p/6lM04Tye0F/

http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Light Brown Feathers;The locks in this style are cut carefully and given a minor side part to create an elegant look.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-balayage-hair-styles/;Shading Perfection;You can color your strands anyhow, but you will only look outstanding with the right formula choice. The dark shadow at the roots of this hairdo is nothing short of perfect but it wouldn't look this good without the soft brown highlights.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shading-Perfection-500x500.jpg;Shading Perfection;https://www.instagram.com/p/z5z5rjSexD/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;All Round Braid and a Bun;Ladies with long hairs will be best suited for this prom style because the braid will require a particular length to create. In the hairdo, a long plaitÂ is weaved around the hair and combined with a bun for a radiant look. ItÂ starts on one side of the head and moves over the forehead to finish on the other side. It is a very simple style to wear provided you have long locks, and you know different braiding techniques.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/All-Round-Braid-and-a-Bun-500x500.jpg;All Round Braid and a Bun; 
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Messy Updo;If you have some fine strands like these, you have to do little to get a great partyÂ hairdo. In this style, the locks have been nicely trimmed for some texture then hand painted to give them a fantastic color. The styling involves roughly pushing the locks back and tying them into a loose knot on the crown.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Messy-Updo-400x500.jpg;Messy Updo;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA__F8NIcUJ/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;The Loose Tendrils;The loose tendrils look almost messy, but this style is achieved by neatly arranging the strands at the back while leaving a section of the hair at the front. The hairs in front should be given a center part before pushing them back, but you should leave two locks on the opposite sides of the part that are styled to flow freely. The loose tendrils at the back are created by arranging the locks.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Loose-Tendrils-418x500.jpg;The Loose Tendrils;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA5MYSmmiBP/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Open Bun Updo;When most people are creating a bun in their updo, they prefer to bring all the hairs together and fold then into the bun, but this style breaks away from the tradition. Instead of folding in the strands they are left to flow beyond the bun as a couple of free long locks.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Open-Bun-Updo-400x500.jpg;Open Bun Updo;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAuu7MaGzta/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Double-Braided Hairdo;Braids always find a way into most prom hairstyles. In fact, they come second to few others regarding the most widely used distinct style on these hairdos. Although they are mostly used to tighten things up in this hairstyle, the double braids that meet at the simple bun form an integral part of this look.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Double-Braided-Hairdo-500x500.jpg;Double-Braided Hairdo;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAqv0cMiagE/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Intricate Fold-In;The design created in this hairdo looks very complicated, and it probably is if you do not know how to style it. However, it will only take a stylist or a person who knows how to make it a couple of minutes to finish it. It is created by folding in the locks in an intricate pattern at the back to create the updo. It is an incredible style for ladies who would not like to have locks handing on their beautiful dress during prom night.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Intricate-Fold-In-400x500.jpg;Intricate Fold-In;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAmihKIlCvd/

http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Twisted and Curled;All the effort in this style is concentrated on the design at the back as there is no other significant styling done at the front and this is a good idea because the outcome is excellent. The strands are pushed back where they are curled and twisted creatively to create an excellent low updo.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Twisted-and-Curled-500x500.jpg;Twisted and Curled;https://www.instagram.com/p/89I26ppvYW/

http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Dutch Bubble French Braid;The dutch bubble french braid is a unique prom style that brings all the hairs together to the middle of the head to create a faux hawk inspired design. To get this hairdo, the strands are divided into chunky sections that are then weaved into a massive French braid at the middle of your head. Since the braid is too large to hold, clear rubber bands should be used to keep it in place.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dutch-Bubble-French-Braid-500x500.jpg;Dutch Bubble French Braid;https://www.instagram.com/p/8wmqQBCXQl/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Messy Short Hairs with Side Braid;Contrary to what most people think you do not have to keep very long locks to wear an amazing prom style.

The bun should just be simple, and so you should not try too hard to make it neat.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Formal-Updo-Style-400x500.jpg;Formal Updo Style;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA56n3EFCld/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Vintage Braided Updo;Braids are some of the most versatile hair designs, and they have been around for many years.

When wearing this hair, you can enhance the look with some floral hair clips.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Vintage-Braided-Updo-500x500.jpg;Vintage Braided Updo;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA4iIMcPyLE/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Soft Messy Braids;The braids in this style have been weaved very creatively, and it is hard to tell that they are there because of the messy strands around them. Although the braids are what makes this an interesting updo, there is also a nicely done bun at the back that comes from folding in the messy strands.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Soft-Messy-Braids-441x500.jpg;Soft Messy Braids;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA3d5LkARfJ/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Curly Twist;You do not have to stick with the conventional hairdos to look great on your prom. The amazing curly twist hairstyle clearly demonstrates this, and it is one style that you can be guaranteed that you will be the only person wearing anything like it at the event. It starts with dividing the hair into a couple of sections at the crown and then twisting them into a French braid before pulling everything together. It is common with many updos but what makes it unique is that instead of being tied into a bun the hairs have some amazing long curly locks.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Curly-Twist-500x500.jpg;Curly Twist;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA_hCtRE5TZ/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Naturally Curly Updo;All that is done in this hairstyle is to push it back with the hands and then pull it together at the back into a medium size bun. However, what makes it look amazing is that the hairs are naturally curly, and this is still evident even after pulling them together. To look good in this style, you should make the bun slightly messy so that the curls can still be visible.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Naturally-Curly-Updo-500x500.jpg;Naturally Curly Updo;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA-SJisPYWi/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Elegant Bridal Tuck In;This hairstyle is a perfect demonstration of the concept behind updos because apart from being immaculate not even a single strand is left to flow freely. What makes it, even more, incredible is that it does not just tuck-in the hair like other conventional styles, but instead the strands are brought together in a pattern. It is a very simple style to wear as you only need to divide the crown hairs into a couple of sections, bring them together in a braid-like pattern and then finish by tucking in.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Elegant-Bridal-Tuck-In-444x500.jpg;Elegant Bridal Tuck In;https://www.instagram.com/p/BADbt5RAnB0/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Knotted Waves;You can almost never go wrong with these hairstyles provided you have a healthy hair and know the look you want to have on your prom. In this style, for example, the wavy strands do all the magic because the only style done is the loose knot at the back. The knot does not incorporate all the locks as a few are left to flow freely and this makes the hairdo more attractive.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Knotted-Waves-500x500.jpg;Knotted Waves;https://www.instagram.com/p/8PlNOygnOL/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;The Twisted Headband;Even if you do not like pulling all your strands together, or you would wish to enjoy some free flow when you go to the prom, there are still many hairdos that you can wear. The twisted headband is an example of a hairdo that helps you maintain some freedom while still looking elegant. Strands at the front are left to flow freely to the face while the headband created by a braiding brings everything else together.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Twisted-Headband-500x500.jpg;The Twisted Headband;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA79mzYTNYL/

http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Modern Sleek Updo;Hairstyles are always changing and in most cases they get better with time as people become more experimental and also thanks to the use of products. This particular hairstyle is very different from what you would expect to see in a prom updo, and this shows that you will stand out.

The styling of the hairs that protrude from the band is what makes it stand out.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Modern-Sleek-Updo-500x500.jpg;Modern Sleek Updo;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA3-0ligtE8/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Twisted Blonde Hairs;Twisting is the easiest way to pull your strands together, and it is also much faster and more attractive. For these long blonde hairs, the twisting is done by pulling together the locks to the back of the head. The twisting technique makes this a perfect hairdo as it does not follow the traditional braiding that most ladies go with.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Twisted-Blonde-Hairs-400x500.jpg;Twisted Blonde Hairs;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA3mBulKjjD/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Extra Large Loose Braids;In this style, the two loose braids on the sides take up much of the hair and so you will not have a lot of hairs to style at the back. The braids are very elegant, and they join to create a fabulous pattern that will make your locks look more intricate than they are.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Extra-Large-Loose-Braids-400x500.jpg;Extra Large Loose Braids;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA0Dgn3TaJL/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Fantastic Flower Braid;The flower braid is one of the prom hair updosÂ that most ladies would wish to have but what discourages most from trying it is that it looks very complicated. However, the fact is that the beautiful flower formed by the braids at the back is easier to create than most other hairdos. All you need to do is to roll up the braids in a flower pattern, but you should have some long braids for this to be possible.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Fantastic-Flower-Braid-500x500.jpg;Fantastic Flower Braid;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAxmsI7vcmP/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Clipped Bun;A hair clip is one of those things that ladies will always find themselves using on the hair even when they do not need it. It is probably because they come in lovely flowers and designs that can make your hairs look attractive. In this style, the hair is roughly pulled back into a loose bun, and so the clip is necessary to hold it in place.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Clipped-Bun-500x500.jpg;Clipped Bun;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAxa7sRmJub/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Reverse French Twist;A reverse French twist makes a perfect hairstyle, but this particular one looks more exquisite as it uses all the strands on your head. Rather than have a thin braid running from the front to the back, it incorporates all the strands to create a massive reverse twist that finishes with a simple fold in at the back.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Reverse-French-Twist-500x500.jpg;Reverse French Twist;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAwSvYQBFoS/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Massive Fishtail;If you have a very long hair, it might be pretty uncomfortable to pull it together into a tight bun, but there are still many other options you can choose for your prom. One such style is the massive fishtail that has been gently loosened to create a more relaxed hairdo.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Massive-Fishtail-400x500.jpg;Massive Fishtail;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAvfVbMhbMB/

http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;The Vintage Updo;Long before the culture of prom was born ladies were still going for balls. During these events, it was always about the hair.

What makes it different is that it always has a beautiful clip to keep the strands in place.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Vintage-Updo-500x500.jpg;The Vintage Updo;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAlZaaMPkcF/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Synthetic Piece;Although it always feels good to have an all natural look adding a synthetic piece can enhance your design and make you look fantastic. For this coiffure, the strands are nicely relaxed then slicked to the center of the head. The piece is added to the hair when it is pulled at the center then pinned together to create the fantastic look. In this style, the most important thing is the technique used to add the piece as this will dictate how natural it will look.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Synthetic-Piece-500x500.jpg;Synthetic Piece;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAk8s4En4kS/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Easy Prom Bun;Here is a perfect example of an easy or non-trivial prom bun that will only take you a couple of minutes to wear. The hairdo comes from wrapping the bun with a twist but what makes it look natural is that the bangs are left loose but still folded in. Although it looks good in blonde, you can always adjust the color to meet your needs and preferences.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Easy-Prom-Bun-500x500.jpg;Easy Prom Bun;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAjoxiSt-jN/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;The Braid Band;Choosing a good coiffure does not have to be complicated because you can still look incredible with a very simple design.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;The Classic Twist;The classic twist is created by simple braiding and twisting at the back.

A smaller braid is then madeÂ above it to createÂ an exquisite pattern.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Classic-Twist-500x500.jpg;The Classic Twist;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAqNqSxLAO3/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-fancy-prom-updos/;Triple Side Braids;A side braid will always spice up your prom updo, but this takes things a notch higher as instead of having one it has three different size and design braids on the side. The twists help to make the strands firmer, and they also create an attractive pattern. Apart from this, the convergence of the braids at the back also creates a fabulous curly mess that further enhances the looks.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Triple-Side-Braids-688x500.jpg;Triple Side Braids;https://www.instagram.com/p/BApHZy8QlSl/

There is an intention not to block the eye view.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Red-Queen-with-Bangs-500x500.jpg;Red Queen with Bangs;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA-wpWyEBRT/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Gray-BlondeMatrix;At the roots in the middle, the hair is dark gray. You can see a thick plume that is covering the head crown. The color changes to blondeness and that is what goes to the end though with lighter variation as you go down. It goes below the shoulder level and end in bluntness. One eye has blocked the view and this is what will raise the curiosity in you.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gray-Blonde-Matrix-500x500.jpg;Gray-Blonde Matrix;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBA3MvfB0Ic/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;The Diva in Her;"If you have never believed the phrase that ""there is a diva in every lady"" then this hairstyle should challenge your opinion. She is beautiful just by having her hair parted at the center and left to fall to as far as it goes. There is a fine tooth-comb used at the top but the effect lessens as it moves down. The ends are curled and you cannot stop wondering how such a simple design could end up being such an attractive appearance.";http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Diva-in-Her-537x500.png;The Diva in Her;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBAxgA7pD-u/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Graduation Long Bob;Viewed from the back it is thick and colorful. The faded pink makes it a top haircut that ladies would not think twice to have on their head. At the lower neck region, it makes some overlaps of love and you would not struggle to decipher why it is ranked highly in the bob hairstyle family. At the front it leaves the face exposed to show off all the cute features endowed on the lady.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Graduation-Long-Bob-543x500.png;Graduation Long Bob;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBAwWFMwAok/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Long Fangs with Bangs;The sides and back fall in a smooth fountain. They are bundled near the end and passed over the shoulders. They are drawn long to form what looks like fangs. At the front, thick bangs form a mat that is swept across the face when it gets near the eyebrows. It has all that a lady would want in a hairstyle whether it is simplicity or magnificence.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Long-Fangs-with-Bangs-500x500.jpg;Long Fangs with Bangs;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBH5YgnkBZW/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Top Bun with Rolls;At the middle, it is as smooth as a bun due to thorough brushing. It begins to roll once it starts the fall to the sides and the back. It makes natural twists that can be seen from far. The tips are left spiky and it is such an appearance that exudes nothing less than a woman's power to be on top of her looks.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Top-Bun-with-Rolls-500x500.jpg;Top Bun with Rolls;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBAoaF4EHMn/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Long Canopy;It can get long and impressive just like you can see in this lady. The hair is parted at the middle top and falls to the sides. It is combed to a precise smoothness to give it a flawless drip just like a natural fountain would be like. The hair is then given a slight push to fall over the front forming a guarding shield around the face.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Long-Canopy-500x500.jpg;Long Canopy;https://www.instagram.com/p/9ml0LCtD-T/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Colorful Crown;A variation of blue and gray is what makes this long bob haircut a must-have for the trendy lady. The hair is drawn to a single thick bundle, finely combed and left with its tips naturally sharp. It is such a top style that will be the talk of your town. Radiant colors on ladies never go wrong and here is another chance to go bold.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Colorful-Crown-500x500.jpg;Colorful Crown;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBAlWOZqPh8/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Chopped Bundles with Curls;The drop begins from the tip of the head in a smooth tone. As it goes down, it begins to part in smaller portions each rolled like a meat chop. They are curly and spiky at the tips. It is leaving the hair in its natural element and it does not disappoint the girl who is looking sleek and urbane.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Chopped-Bundles-with-Curls-500x500.jpg;Chopped Bundles with Curls;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBAen7Kv4w5/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Layered Impression;The hair is parted into unequal portions ad this results to a layering impression. There are the falls to the opposite directions and they go as low as beyond the shoulders. The thicker side cover the entire cheek and ears while the sparse one fall behind the ear creating a contrast. They both end at the front of the temples with blunt tips. It is simple yet you cannot underestimate the overall creation of an angelic prettiness.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Layered-Impression-400x500.jpg;Layered Impression;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBAYpvtHBlD/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Fountains of Beauty;In light shades, the hair falls to the sides and goes all the way beyond the shoulders. On the rising loop, one end goes higher than the other but they both fall to the same length. This lady will get stares her way thanks to her style to keep it real and powerful with her hair. Everything is so right that she would not need any further complement to be declared a diva.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Fountains-of-Beauty-500x500.jpg;Fountains of Beauty;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBAWCk5Pbb7/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Sunset Waves;In color, this hair resembles the setting sun over the west horizon. The glow is not strong but it will still be noticeable from afar. It is thicker on one part while the other is leaner but they all remain the same in length. There is a tendency not to brush the hair and it is left with natural waves that make this a unique pick since most ladies would go for a smoother finish. The tips are not trimmed and it rests over the shoulder. Only a few strands pass over the forehead but they do not obscure anything you should want to see.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sunset-Waves-500x500.jpg;Sunset Waves;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBACOI4GTUc/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Modern Classic Flip;Hairstyles always keep pace with changing times and seasons. She has her hair flipped to one thick side and it drops almost to the shoulder level but it makes no contact. The back and sides are trimmed to a blunt finish but they are longer at the front strands. One eye (the one on the thicker side) is concealed and that gives it the modern taste of the long lob.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Modern-Classic-Flip-500x500.jpg;Modern Classic Flip;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA7Zo1okBaL/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Beautiful Lobs;The good thing for the ladies is that a simple haircut would make her a top model without the need to do anything more. This is what such a beautiful design has done to this fair lady. A not-so-clear parting line divides the mane and each falls the opposite way. It is smooth at the top but it starts to get curly midway of the dropping length. They end up resting over the shoulders in an attractive pose that you can't resist having a look. The face is slightly touched by strands but the bigger part is left blazing in beauty.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Beautiful-Lobs-500x500.jpg;Beautiful Lobs;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA_bNzEHQrX/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Grooved Cheeks;You would think that the hair is a natural part of the cheeks. It makes smooth grooves around them and you will be amazed by the many stops you get being asked who did the styling. The hair is equally portioned from the top and combed to the fine mat that follows the side falls of the head. At one end, half of the forehead is banged and this adds to the glamor in this style. It may be a simple hairdo but it achieves what a modern lady would want in her haircut.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Grooved-Cheeks-500x500.jpg;Grooved Cheeks;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBIJUbngpcW
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Smooth and Elegant;Call her the queen of bobs because that is what her hairstyle says. Proportionally parted at the top, the hair drops with acute smoothness and each side ends in a unified bundle below the chin. They are pointed at the ends and that is a way to keep her exclusively pretty to the last details.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Smooth-and-Elegant-500x500.jpg;Smooth and Elegant;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBIGzikL5mS/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Banged Wonder Curls;"It is never a convention that the lobs should be refined and smooth; you can have them curled like this lady. The patch at the top is smooth but as it begins to fall a rough tone takes over. Laces and laces of curls cover the back and sides. Short impressive bangs remain parched at the forehead and it is such a defined appealing appearance.";http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Banged-Wonder-Curls-500x500.jpg;Banged Wonder Curls;https://www.instagram.com/p/4pdaX-Dk9c/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Blond Side Flip;The smile says that she knows that she is cute and you can attest to that. You can have the hair flipped to one side and then left to run long without any sort of trim. This is a versatile style since you can as well draw the hair to the back but this time, you give it a trim for it to adhere to the code of all other bobs.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Blond-Side-Flip-500x500.jpg;Blond Side Flip;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBCXUYayyBa/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Rounded Appearance;It is thick at the midway of the falling hair. This gives it an attractive roundness only broken at the forehead. Bundles of strands are not combed to uniformity as they are left to form layers over each other.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rounded-Appearance-500x500.jpg;Rounded Appearance;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBBgx-BsUAw/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-bob-haircuts/;Wavy Haute;Bundles of strands interlace over each other and you would not clearly define what the stylist wanted to achieve. But that is the mystery in this style that would compel you to choose it. It is rough towards the ends and falls longer at the front.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wavy-Haute-500x500.jpg;Wavy Haute;https://www.instagram.com/p/sVzJGkE69O/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Fiery Stack;The hair falls from the crown and fully obscures one side of the ear and partly the eye. It is thick and smooth but ends with sharp tips that seem like glued to the neck region. For casual or formal functions you have your beauty taken care of so you do not have to worry what others will see in you.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Fiery-Stack-500x500.jpg;Fiery Stack; 
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Glowing Tips;If you look carefully, there is a golden yellow glow at hair tips at the back. They are the eye-catching point of the creation. The hair drops to the back and the sides and keeps away from touching the shoulders. The forehead is left untouched by a single strand and you can see the lady's beauty in every angle.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Glowing-Tips-500x500.jpg;Glowing Tips;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA3eKPZzMQE/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Bleached Plume;The hair is light white but not that deep in color. It is gray at the tips to add to the play of colors. It falls thick from one half and it is impressive with the fine comb tooth that has given it a smooth finish. There is an intention to trim it at the tips and that achieves a blunt look which makes it a super bob.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bleached-Plume-400x500.jpg;Bleached Plume;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA6SXl1BLgt/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Medium Blond with Bangs;It is a medium size that will be a ready-to-go style for the office lady. A big portion of the hair is drawn towards the back and it lies over the back neck slightly above the blouse collar. At one side there is a fall that is aesthetically treated to long bangs. The other side is tilted towards the back and it makes contrasting waves.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Medium-Blond-with-Bangs-400x500.jpg;Medium Blond with Bangs;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA9uQxJkBfQ/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Full Bang;One side is dropped to what seems to be single wide bangs that extend from the forehead to the half of the back. It obscures one of the eyes leaving the other as the source of front view. You can tell that it is not such an easy choice but only for a lady who wants something unique.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Full-Bang-500x500.jpg;Full Bang;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAepjPIEBfM/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Sunset Frenzy;It is messy, rough and curled and the results are what you are seeing: a sunset fury. The hair is left rough and with its natural entangles untouched. What adds the frenzy is the color that depicts what you see at the horizon when the sun is setting. There is a differentiation of the intensity of the hues since the low back is darker than the top and sides.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sunset-Frenzy-500x500.jpg;Sunset Frenzy;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAXTJHDEBW4/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Cute Drop;For those who know how to see a good thing from afar, you would not miss to notice the cuteness that comes with this design. It drops to one side and tries to expose the ear but only a small patch is left in the clear. The bundles at one side are pooled together to form thick ends over the cheek. At the back it is trimmed and pressed to remain in touch with the skin.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cute-Drop-444x500.jpg;Cute Drop;https://www.instagram.com/p/BADHLKckBXp/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Light and Gray Wind;If this is not a genius creation then you can never have something better. It is light at the tips and some shades of gray at the roots. What makes it astounding is the wind effect at the backwards sweep. It seems as if the hair is being blown to the back and that is the best aspect that makes this a top choice among ladies.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Light-and-Gray-Wind-500x500.jpg;Light and Gray Wind;https://www.instagram.com/p/_ZLCAzEBV1/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Maroon Curls;It is smooth at the front but makes some mild waves that give you a taste of the more turbulent back. It is layered into 3 portions: back, one long side and a smaller one. The sides and back are intensively curly.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Maroon-Curls-500x500.jpg;Maroon Curls;https://www.instagram.com/p/_MZrNOkBYY/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Soft and Shiny;It is shiny and soft but that is spoiled by some of the strands that do not sit where they are intended. At the neck it sticks to the skin like worms and it is all attractive from every corner. It is simple but still passes the test of prettiness.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Soft-and-Shiny-400x500.jpg;Soft and Shiny;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAxpxflkBc2/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Blond Long Beauty;It can go as long as the shoulder level and then give it acute trims at the tips. It falls to one side with not-so-smooth bundles but they are synchronized to form a uniform mat. It covers one eye and that is an addition to set it aside from other types that try the same.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Blond-Long-Beauty-500x500.jpg;Blond Long Beauty;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAsgdYaNA_k/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Blowing Fire;It is a causal bob that you can go with at the gym or your usual jog. Thick mop forms around the head but keeps away from the front. It is styled to point inwards at the ends. At the low ends it is like a blowing fire.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Blowing-Fire-500x500.jpg;Blowing Fire;https://www.instagram.com/p/BArxOr-Pyae/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Smooth Hood;None of the other styles beats this one in smoothness. It is combed into acute finesse and drops flawlessly. At the back it is trimmed to an inverted C-shave. The forehead is left in the clear to show its exquisiteness.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Smooth-Hood-500x500.jpg;Smooth Hood;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAp0mRNPMEO/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Side Pigtail;It is another type from the smooth family but this one goes thicker and intense. It is brushed to a downward fall. The back is tilted to one side and rolled into what looks like a pigtail. It would win the catwalk if it was all about the hair.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Side-Pigtail-421x500.jpg;Side Pigtail;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA9rsXPoGIL/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Brown Coiffeur;The back takes dominance in this one. It is thick and creates an underloop effect where some of the top patch sinks into. From the front is a drooling thickness that ends in an extreme bluntness at the nape.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Brown-Coiffeur-500x500.jpg;Brown Coiffeur;https://www.instagram.com/p/BA-9Pe2qHos/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Layered Top;It is parted with a clear straight line and each portion falls to the sides. It is closely brushed to fine smoothness. It is top rated and you will see it with celebs as they make public appearances.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Layered-Top-500x500.jpg;Layered Top;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAp7Wosymp5/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Light Chubs;One eye is completely covered by the large side drop. The rest is styled into thick bundles that look like ribs. It is gorgeous and unique hence a top pick for those who want to define their hair styling to outstanding differentiation.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Light-Chubs-479x500.jpg;Light Chubs;https://www.instagram.com/p/BApUpzXg0BA/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Multi-Directional Laces;"It is flat and smooth at the top but the tone changes after a short drop. Each bundle of strands takes to its own devices and points to whatever direction it desires. It is a mess of directional laces but they all end up making a stunning finish; that is a fantastic inverted bob. The gals from the wild type would want such a look on them for so many parties they are invited.";http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Multi-Directional-Laces-420x500.jpg;Multi-Directional Laces;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAm8p_mPGDm/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Lady Dalliance;This is a lady who will not struggle to impress the guys because the hair has done that for her. It is long at the front that covers one eye and shorter all round but do not underestimate its general length. It is only one eye that is left in the open but in there it covers a beautiful face.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lady-Dalliance-500x500.jpg;Lady Dalliance;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBAWIy_EBWZ/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Double Fountain;She would get a top vote for being unique and stylish. All the hair drops from the top middle and falls to the sides. This time it goes beyond the forehead and forms a fence-like impression around the face. Its length increases as it goes to the front. This is for the lady who wants to keep her beauty concealed from preying men.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Double-Fountain-500x500.jpg;Double Fountain;https://www.instagram.com/p/2_6wTQqBne/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Pink Princess;She has her hair in pink and all the attention is on her head wherever she passes. The hair is flattened from the top and runs to the sides and back. It makes calculated waves some over the other and it is intricate. You would be right to assume this bob style would deserve a standing ovation (especially form the menfolk).;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Pink-Princess-500x500.jpg;Pink Princess;https://www.instagram.com/p/-SRoXnEBc_/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Inside-Out Beauty;You would expect the light portion of the hair to be under the thick gray mop. That was the intention of the stylist to do the opposite of expectations and it has won the hearts of many ladies. It is trimmed at the nape and it lies on the skin like a natural part of it. The bottom section is smooth while the top is rough and the mix is a perfect finish.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Inside-Out-Beauty-480x500.jpg;Inside-Out Beauty;https://www.instagram.com/p/-EZFW8EBf0/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Blazing Glory;The tone and color definitely make this a bold style for ladies who want to show their beautiful features. It is an intense right angle side sweep that entirely conceals the entire cheek and ear. At the front portion tips are left spiked but at the back they are trimmed to unsharpened ends. The lady deserves all that blazing glory on her head for the show of boldness.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Blazing-Glory-500x500.jpg;Blazing Glory;https://www.instagram.com/p/98tpOzEBSU/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Parallel Layers;A big chunk of the hair falls all around the head but it is thicker on one side than the other. It is a mixture of shades from light gray to brown and that blends so well for the final results. The topmost layer runs towards the back and only makes it as far as the back drop of the head. As it is with the bobble styles, the back neckline is clipped to remain intact and close to the skin.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Parallel-Layers-500x500.jpg;Parallel Layers;https://www.instagram.com/p/9vxmRGEBd-/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Immaculate Lady;It is perfect in every angle whether you view it from the front, the sides or back. The fall from the middle is well marked and it is proportionate all round. It is wavy in all bundles but the intensity increases at the back. A not-so-thick bundle of bangs tries to run over one ear but it does not conceal it completely.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Immaculate-Lady-500x500.jpg;Immaculate Lady;https://www.instagram.com/p/9Yk9TmkBVL/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Bold Hue;You cannot deny the fact that she is bold and would not be deterred by conspicuous colors to show it. The first thing you notice would be the radiant glow of purple. It is a color for the ladies and it has been done aptly. The long fall is as low as the shoulder level and it is spiraled to fall over one of them.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bold-Hue-400x500.jpg;Bold Hue;https://www.instagram.com/p/9RwzrlEBdD/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Shaggy Inversion;"It is not always smooth and precise with the bobs; sometimes it gets rough but not so out of hand. Here was no any intention to have a smooth mop as it is good shaggy from up to the bottom. The inner section may have tried to be smooth but the top layer spoils the show in a good way.";http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shaggy-Inversion-400x500.jpg;Shaggy Inversion;https://www.instagram.com/p/9JJMl7EBWf/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Long Racing Blonde;It gets long here and you can see that it is not such a bad choice. The side falls are dragged towards the front at their ends and they rest over the chest. They do not converge so it seems like there is a barricade between them.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Long-Racing-Blonde-500x500.jpg;Long Racing Blonde;https://www.instagram.com/p/9It4lAEBY_/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Slight Back Tilt;There is an intention to part the hair but that does not end so well. The hair falls all around the head save the front. At the back it is slightly tilted to one side. It is not smooth and that is unique about this piece.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Slight-Back-Tilt-500x500.jpg;Slight Back Tilt;https://www.instagram.com/p/9E5k7okBS6/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Thick and Bouncy;Natural curls and waves are all over the head and they look gorgeous. The thick bundles fall over the ears completely covering them. No strand makes it to the front to show the great facial features.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Thick-and-Bouncy-500x500.jpg;Thick and Bouncy;https://www.instagram.com/p/9BIhI1EBf9/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Browny Beauty;It is intended to fall to the sides but not to cover the ears. After a short drop to the sides, the hair is swept towards the back. It leaves her face, cheekbones and jaws in the open for admiration.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Browny-Beauty-400x500.jpg;Browny Beauty;https://www.instagram.com/p/8_XcspkBar/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Red Happiness;A typical part line is done from one end to give a bigger share to one side. It starts smoothly at the origin but gets curly towards the tips. It is thick and layered as it makes the final races close to the ear and it does not touch the skin on the neck though it goes that low.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Red-Happiness-500x500.jpg;Red Happiness;https://www.instagram.com/p/85h04SEBR3/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;The Bowl Impression;It is not what you would call a bowl style but sure there is something borrowed from that iconical cut. What is missing is that the hair does not fall over the forehead but only the sides. It is not long enough to reach the shoulders probably to expose the decorated earrings.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-Bowl-Impression-400x500.jpg;The Bowl Impression;https://www.instagram.com/p/8qrGy2EBSW/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Faux Hawk;This is not what you would call a Mohawk but there is some inspiration from it.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Thick and Long Bob;All around the head is a gray thickness and you would notice that a charming lady is passing-by showing off her inverted bob. It is long too and misses the shoulder by less than an inch. The only place left in the clear is the face but one eye is completely obscured. It is a top choice and ladies would love it on their head.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Thick-and-Long-Bob-400x500.jpg;Thick and Long Bob;https://www.instagram.com/p/8Awd0KkBU4/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Proud Blonde;She has her mop gray at the roots but as you go down you will notice that she is a true blond. The hair is drawn downwards forming a smooth fountain. It is styled in a way that the group of strands at the front are longer than those at the back. It is a creative design and ladies would rather pay an arm and leg to have it (but that effort needless).;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Proud-Blonde.jpg;Proud Blonde;https://www.instagram.com/p/8BVg_SkBar/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;No-Seeing-You;She is saying that she does not want you to see her eyes or something to that effect. The bangs fall over her eyes blocking the front view but she can sweep them aside and see the beauty that she tries so hard to conceal. The sides and back make a grooving impression around the neck. It is sleek and you will see it in ladies who want a true definition of their femininity.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/No-Seeing-You-500x500.jpg;No-Seeing-You;https://www.instagram.com/p/-6bTUlkBXN/

http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Wavy and Messy;It all begins well at the top only to get messy and rough at the tips. But that is not an excuse to dismiss it for being out of the contest for the exquisite bobs. It starts wide and then grows thinner and all the side strands seem to come into a confluence around the shoulder level. The lady misses nothing on her head and she must be noticing the long stare that will be coming her way.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wavy-and-Messy-500x500.jpg;Wavy and Messy;https://www.instagram.com/p/-rhB7qEBQJ/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Non-Defined Direction Curls;A small part line tries to divide the hair but its efforts are just mild and get lost in the matrix of curls. The hair runs into all directions making C-curls that have no specific formation. The face is left unperturbed and no doubt that she has the face of a model.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Non-Defined-Direction-Curls-400x500.jpg;Non-Defined Direction Curls;https://www.instagram.com/p/_XgwzDvLIC/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Blond and Pink Splendor;If you were to vote for her as the queen of beauty you would thanks to her elegant hairstyle.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Fading Falls;She has that look of a calm queen who knows that whatever she does she will still be admired.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Simple Hairdo;None of the other bobs gets as simple as this one. It is just a line that creates a boundary and the hair falls on the opposite directions. Some brushing or combing, whichever is comfortable, is done but not to the intense flatness you would expect.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Simple-Hairdo-400x500.jpg;Simple Hairdo;https://www.instagram.com/p/9REyQkvLIx/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Curving Chops;It is like the hair was being chopped into long pieces: some longer than the others.

One of the eyes is concealed and it comes out as genius creativity.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Curving-Chops-400x500.jpg;Curving Chops;https://www.instagram.com/p/8rLo6nvLL0/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;All-Round Plume;The head is surrounded and you would think that was a mistake but wait till you see the end results.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;The Back Coiffeur;In a single bundle, all the hair is pulled to the back and ends in lateral crosses but without a knot.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Double Banged Bob;It covers the back head and the cheeks as it slants towards the front.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-inverted-bob-hairstyles/;Triple Portioning;Her hair is portioned into 3: the back and 2 sides.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-strawberry-blonde-hair/;Double Tone;How would you describe a mixture of dark brown and light golden? It is simply a perfect match for hair tonal variation that will be as impressive as any lady would wish to be. The top has the dark impression while the falls are light.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-strawberry-blonde-hair/;Textured Brown;From a far, the hair looks like it is laced with sand gritties and that you would feel some roughness once you touch it. The choice of color is blowing hot and complements her skin tone. It is perfectly befitting that she has a close shade to her skin color and so she will not have a clashing of the two. It is subtle to the finer details and for a lady who would want to be a center of attention (of course positive attention), this is the best choice.Â ;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Textured-Brown-500x500.jpg;Textured Brown;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBJX2_gN8PS/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-strawberry-blonde-hair/;Glowing Fountains;The hue goes deeper and it looks like an overly painted job. But no, it is the intensity of the tone that makes this a popular shade that ladies would give all just to have it. It has a glowing effect on the upper layer and it is such a graceful appearance for any woman who knows how to shine but not overdoing it. There is a mild effort to vary the intensity of the color density but it does not make any considerable alteration.Â ;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Glowing-Fountains-500x500.jpg;Glowing Fountains;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBD0FIxEvlA/
http://tophairstyles.net/best-strawberry-blonde-hair/;Red-Back Pearls;This is not what would pass to be the conventional red but you are seeing some resemblance here.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-strawberry-blonde-hair/;Angelic Curls;The radiance of this hairstyle will be the first thing to attract your attention.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-strawberry-blonde-hair/;Side Flip;The two sides are different in 2 ways: the color intensity and the point at which the drop begins. The longer and flipped side had a darker complexion than the other one. It looks like an intentional mistake from the stylist but it is all about creating something unique.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Side-Flip-500x500.jpg;Side Flip;https://www.instagram.com/p/BBGw4nOQLRn/

http://tophairstyles.net/best-strawberry-blonde-hair/;Straight Beige;Having it done in uniformity removes the chances of ever getting it wrong with any aspect.

http://tophairstyles.net/best-strawberry-blonde-hair/;Slight Tilt and Short;Having her hair darker on one side is such a top idea that she had to make to this list.

Nothing is missed and this is simply beauty at its peak form.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Twilight-Glow-500x500.jpg;Twilight Glow;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAqicFpnAv-/

http://tophairstyles.net/best-short-bob-hairstyles/;Layered Bob with Highlights;A short bob is one of the simplest hairdos that you can wear, and most designs will not even require you to use the services of a professional. With standard styling tools such as a comb and the other usual things that you use on your hair at home, you can have a layered bob in a matter of minutes. This style is a perfect example of this because all that one should do on the naturally straight strands is to razor cut the ends to make them pointier. The color is also important in this look and so you can create some nice highlight to compliment your design, but you should always choose the colors keenly. For the styling, you should start by creating a center part on your thick strands, and you have the option to make it shallow like in this style or have a distinctive line using a comb. You should then finish the look by spraying your locks and letting them flow freely.;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Layered-Lob-with-Highlights-500x500.jpg;Layered Lob with Highlights;https://www.instagram.com/p/4kbGbZwcEU/

If you are not sure what to use it is a good idea to stick with chocolate brown;http://tophairstyles.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Short-and-Classy-500x500.jpg;Short and Classy;https://www.instagram.com/p/4fWbJHQcGE/
