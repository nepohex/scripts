In case you are into more structured styles, leave the hair a little bit longer on top.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/√ê¬±√ê¬∞√ê¬∑-√ê¬∫√ê¬∞√ë¬Ç-650x553.jpg;;https://www.instagram.com/p/BPI55tcjgSK/

Therefore, the question as to whether or not women like beards is something that is up for debate.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12751615_1513451432295852_815798880_n-650x650.jpg;; 
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array;Scientific studies have been conducted to paint a clear picture regarding the subject. One was conducted in the 1970s while the other was conducted four years ago. Despite the huge time difference that the studies were conducted, both of them came to a similar conclusion:;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12917807_250736975274046_1915710891_n-650x652.jpg;; 
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array;Women find more attraction to men with stubble or light beards. Men with full-grown beards were found least attractive owing to their aggressive yet mature look. Those with no facial hair were second-least attractive but had no what it takes to form the perfect romantic partners.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/3-650x488.jpg;;https://www.instagram.com/p/BCXuiKUBpXI/
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array;Women find more attraction to men with stubble or light beards.

Those with no facial hair were second-least attractive but had no what it takes to form the perfect romantic partners.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/4-650x804.jpg;; 
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array;Two different statistics were also conducted to seek women's opinions on male facial hair. One was in the form of a simple poll that asked a large sample of women whether they are attracted to men with facial hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-650x650.jpg;;https://www.instagram.com/p/BD85AJJhpeK/
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array;The report showed that the majority of women find men with beards unattractive. The second study drew a comparison between clean shaven and bearded men. The women were provided with photos lineups of men and asked to select the most attractive.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/6-650x812.jpg;; 
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array;A majority chose photos of bearded men over the clean-shaven ones. This study actually contradicted the findings from the simple poll.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/7-650x650.jpg;; 
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array;So what does that mean? Well, it shows that the way women perceive you is just not up to you. From the above studies, it is clear that women hold different views regarding beards. Some prefer men with beards while others see such men as a total waste of their time.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/8-650x812.jpg;;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHqydL-gyQl/
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array;So it's all about preferences. However, there must be an explanation from each side of the divide. In this article, we are going to look at why some women like beards and why others don't. Let's first look at why women prefer facial hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/9-650x650.jpg;; 
http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;The Wavy Temple Fade;This taper fade is one of the most preferred among Caucasian males as it embraces both curly hair and edgy trims. The type of fade applied is a low temple fade that runs behind the ear. The fade is minimal as it does not fade into skin, which is good because of the lack of even skin tone.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/The-Wavy-Temple-Fade-650x650.jpg;The Wavy Temple Fade; 
http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Buzz Cut Temple Fade;Buzz cuts and fades like this are common in the military. The old-fashioned   hairstyle is made trendy with a bald fade at the temples and at the back to give it a clearer outline. It also looks better as the hair grows back because the top always looks thicker than the sides.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Buzz-Cut-Temple-Fade-650x650.jpg;Buzz Cut Temple Fade;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHyn6QrhdVk/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Slicked Back Top with High Tape-up;This is a perfectly layered fade that gradually tapers back into the skin then tapers back up into a full, rugged beard.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Spiky High Top Fade;Spiky hair is already pretty cool. This hairstyle is more of a modern version of the old-fashioned high top fades because the sides have been aligned all the way to the top. The fade is high, starting a couple of inches above the ear and tapering into the skin.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Spiky-High-Top-Fade-650x650.jpg;Spiky High Top Fade;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHVqGP0Dcgz/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Parted Top with Temple Fade;The classic parted look combines well with a little tapering of the sides.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Wavy Top with Medium Taper;Another favorite of the Caucasian male, the hair on the crown remains wavy as a moderate fade tapers the hair down the sides.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Long Top Combover with Temple Fade;This haircut can easily pass off as formal as it is very presentable.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Curly Top with Low Bald Fade;The perfect contrast between the thick, curly hair on the crown and the entirely bald area towards the hairline is the main appeal of this trendy cut.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Vintage Curly Top with Bald Fade;This look incorporates a vintage top with a curl hanging over the brow.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Thick Top with Low Fade;This slight tapering of the hairline gives a stylish edge to the curly hair of men with darker complexions. The fade takes on different levels of tapering at the temple and at the back with the rest of the hair untouched. The groomed beard ruggedizes the look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Thick-Top-with-Low-Fade-650x655.jpg;Thick Top with Low Fade;https://www.instagram.com/p/BHrFWlMDVtd/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Curly Fade;Thick curls are already a timelessly appealing hair type. However, with a slight bald fade that tapers into the skin at the edge of the hairline, the style is made more defined and more consistent. The hair on the sides tapers back up at the sideburns and continues to thicken towards the beard.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Curly-Fade-1-650x650.jpg;Curly Fade;https://www.instagram.com/p/BG33tORlOxU/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Vintage Combover with Low Fade;The wavy vintage top with a diagonally parted middle looks classy enough on its own.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Curly Low Fade Haircut;The thick, curly top is a common sight among men with kinky hair as it looks better with the afro-like canopy. The sleek low fade around the thick top accentuates the prominence of the crown while the right-angled line-up shapes up the temples nicely.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Curly-Low-Fade-Haircut-650x650.jpg;Curly Low Fade Haircut;https://www.instagram.com/p/BG-RfudR5HR/

http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Spiky Top Skin Fade;This tape up requires some fine skills on your barber's part as it features a smooth fade that tapers the spiky top nicely down the sides into a bald fade at the hairline.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;Backwards Taper Fade;Although subtle, the taper fade that brings down the top at the back into a nice bald fade is actually very hard to achieve.

http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;;There has always been a debate on what determines hair thickness. Every person wishes to have thick strands especially on the head, and this is what brings about interest in the factors that determine hair thickness.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/11.jpg;; 
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;;However, it is an unquestionable fact that your genetics will affect the thickness of your hair. The same way that your genes will determine the texture, color and length of your strands is just the same way they will influence their thickness.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/42638e56dd98167a65356786564a73ef.jpg;inf; 
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;;A good example of this is the fact that Asian hairs are about 30% thicker than those for Africans and slightly more than 50% more voluminous than the Europeans. Genetics influence the volume of hair follicles and the thicker your follicles are, the thicker your hair will be.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2-650x650.jpg;; 
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;;Other factors such as age also have an effect on how thick your strands will be. As you grow old, your strands will not be as healthy as they were in your younger years and so they will appear thinner. No matter how many times you shave your strands you can never get back the volume that you lose due to age, and this should be enough proof that shaving does not affect hair thickness.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ff14433153cfc2f034302628b15034ff.jpg;inf;https://www.instagram.com/p/BGpTYg-lpxv/
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;;Other factors that may alter the volume of your locks include disease and how you treat them. Most types of cancer and other skin conditions will cause hair loss and in most cases when or if the strands grow back, they will appear thinner than before.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/3-650x650.jpg;; 
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;;Subjecting your hairs to harsh chemicals or too much heat may also affect their thickness and in most cases the strands become fragile with time.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6-650x812.jpg;; 
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;Array;Contrary to what most people think the medical or scientific literature has a lot of information regarding this topic. The debate on whether shaving and thickness have any relationship has been there for hundreds of years. And so it was only a matter of time before scientists took the liberty to prove or refute this claim.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4c9244fae8947e833f46a0a610c53e79.jpg;inf; 
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;Array;The first in-depth research into the subject was in 1928 where four men participated in a hair regrowth experiment. In conducting these studies the men cut the strands on their faces in one downward stroke using the same shaving soap, a similar brand of razor, and water at the same and constant temperature.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5-650x401.jpg;; 
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;Array;The authors of the study collected the strands and compared them with the ones that grew back, and the simple conclusion was that there was no relationship between shaving and a person‚Äôs hair texture, color or its volume.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4-650x416.jpg;; 
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;Array;Although the research in the 1920's was very detailed, it did not bring an end to this debate. In fact, over the years, there have been more scientific studies, but the notion that shaving your whiskers makes them denser is still there.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/7-650x813.jpg;;https://www.instagram.com/p/BGnPccoieR6/
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;Array;Another important study on this subject is the one published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology in 1970 and just like most previous ones the conclusion was that trimming your strands will not affect their thickness in any way.;;;

http://machohairstyles.com/best-man-bun-hairs/;Messy Low Bun;This style is ideal for a man who wishes to maintain a natural look and does not have a lot of time to spare for styling his hair. To create it you should finger-comb your hairs to the back and then tie them into a loose low bun. You do not have to make it neat, and instead, you should leave a few locks flowing freely. Leaving the few free strands is what gives it the messy and natural look and hence making it a trendy design.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Messy-Low-Bun-650x812.jpg;Messy Low Bun; 
http://machohairstyles.com/best-man-bun-hairs/;Colored and Braided Bun;If you prefer something detailed and fancy, then you should try this cool hairdo with your long strands. This style starts by introducing some color to your locks, but you can also use colored extensions if you do not wish to dye your locks. The next step is to create some fancy cornrows in the crown and then finish all of them at the center of the head where you should roll and tie them into a bun. You can also braid the strands below it or just leave them flowing to the back.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Colored-and-Braided-Bun-650x650.jpg;Colored and Braided Bun;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFfG1L1rwxO/

It involves pulling the strands on the crown into a tight knot and then creating a hard side part line below it. You should then taper the strands below the line to the same level as your sideburns.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Crown-Bun-with-Side-Part-and-Tapering-650x650.jpg;Crown Bun with Side Part and Tapering;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFgok7Vq0-X/

You can also braid your hair and let one-half of the braids fall to the right and the other half to the left. ;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Large-bun-braids.jpg;Large bun braids; 
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Intricate Male Braids;Notice how every single braid has been used to form the man bun. It is a very good idea if you don't want some of them to fall into your face and ears. ;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Intricate-male-braids-650x520.jpg;Intricate male braids;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFjnQfePWz7/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Partially Hanging Braids;Do you fancy detailed hairstyles? Try this intricate look. Rocky has half of his braids falling on one side and the other half held at the back. You can choose any other style that impresses you (like forming a Mohawk).;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Partially-hanging-braids-650x813.jpg;Partially hanging braids;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFjZNw9CY2D/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Braided Mini Bun;This is a simple style that involves dividing your braids into two. Leave the first group to hang freely and then form a bun with the other group.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braided-mini-bun-650x813.jpg;Braided mini-bun;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFjNaQYOMnk/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Low Bun;Rather than having a large bun, you can make it fairly small by weaving just a few braids to form a mini-bun.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Low-bun-650x650.jpg;Low bun;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFi5GwCJIir/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Frontal Hanging Braids;This is actually one of the most common   with braids. Rather than having the bun at the top, put it at the back of the head and just above the neck. It adds amazing visual interest to your braids.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Frontal-hanging-braids-650x650.jpg;Frontal hanging braids;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFio-59K6jr/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Amazing Intricate Patterns;Want to have some free hanging braids and still keep your bun? Try this stunning blend of the two. Let the braids at the front fall freely and then tie the ones at the back to form a mini-bun.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Amazing-intricate-patterns-650x788.jpg;Amazing intricate patterns;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFhstyvhXtp/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Braided Ponytail;Ordinary can be boring and that is why braids can be styled into amazing intricate patterns. Let two or a few extend all the way to the neck and then add a trendy style to the ones at the top. ;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braided-Ponytail-650x669.jpg;Braided Ponytail;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFhdxiLwRVt/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;The French Man Braid;As the braids are long ponytail is not a problem. Only some front ones that are shorter are sticking out.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/The-Frenchman-braid-650x650.jpg;The Frenchman braid;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAjCdYTlD9m/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Classic Cornrows;This is an awesome variation of the classic braids and man bun. Yes, it involves creating a bun from your braids but only two or very few braids are used to create it. The rest are left to hang freely.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Classic-cornrows-650x650.jpg;Classic cornrows;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFgZq4tmNX7/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Braids with Hat Accessory;Definitely one of the most recognizable and loved braided looks of our time. It features cornrows that run from one side of the head to the other (and not from the front to the back). It was synonymous with rappers like Jim Jones and Xzibit but Asap Rocky has made it even more popular. For an ideal look, try varying the sizes of the braids and find one that suits your head perfectly.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braids-with-hat-accessories-650x650.jpg;Braids with hat accessories;https://www.instagram.com/p/BDePHOhBXpi/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Braided Bun with Ribbon;We have already mentioned how you can accessorize your braids with a cap. Of course, Asap Rocky does it great but you can do it even better by having a different type of hat (like one without a visor). ;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braided-bun-with-ribbon-650x650.jpg;Braided bun with ribbon;https://www.instagram.com/p/BASdEtvBXq9/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Braids with Invisible Scalp;Instead of weaving your braids at the back (to form a bun), you can just hold them together using a ribbon. The advantage of this style is that you won't have to intertwine your braids together and that makes it easy to make or remove the bun.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braids-with-invisible-scalp-650x650.jpg;Braids with invisible scalp;https://www.instagram.com/p/_7gq8OhXu1/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Marley Twists;More often than not, Asap Rocky's hairdo will reveal his scalp. That is not to say that he doesn't rock braids that don't. You can also style your braids to hide the scalp by collecting them together and tying all of them at the back.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Marley-twists-650x650.jpg;Marley twists;https://www.instagram.com/p/_kgvanBXo8/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Straight Line Braids;Choose this style if you want your braids to look like dreadlocks. It is ideal if your hair is long and thick. ;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Straight-line-braids.jpg;Straight line braids;https://www.instagram.com/p/7K5JeMhXps/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Braid Flicks;One advantage of rocking straight line braids is that you can experiment with designs. Asap Rocky wears his from side to side but you can alter yours to run from the front to the back. The bandana is an added accessory that adds personality.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braid-flicks.jpg;Braid flicks;https://www.instagram.com/p/5xAe4aBXl8/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Braids with Pattern;You can flick one or few of your braids in the same way that other people flick their frontal hair. This style brings attention to your face and facial features more than your hairdo.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Braids-with-pattern.jpg;Braids with pattern;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFeLeTtQiFR/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-asap-rocky-braids/;Creative Cornrows;Do not focus so much on the braids and forget that you can use the pattern that forms on the scalp to enhance your outlook. In the image, Asap Rocky's scalp shows cubes (or rectangles). For you, any pattern of your choice should work well.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Creative-cornrows-650x729.jpg;Creative cornrows;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFXbyG-JfQz/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-juice-haircuts/;Low Juice Haircut;"Remember Tupac in the movie ""Juice""? He rocked a haircut like this one; except for the fact that his was a high cut.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-juice-haircuts/;Tapered Fade and Afro;This tampered   features a high sitting afro with very clean and sharp lines. The sides are tapered to create a gradient effect, and the afro is shaped at precise angles that match the shape of your head. ;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tapered-Fade-and-Afro-650x650.jpg;Tapered Fade and Afro;https://www.instagram.com/p/BFdCZabgx4g/

http://machohairstyles.com/best-juice-haircuts/;Black Faded Flat Top;This flat top style originated from African Americans. It can either be a low or high cut. The outstanding channeling gives it an impressive gradient and thus a great resultant outlook.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Black-Faded-Flat-Top-650x460.jpg;Black Faded Flat Top;https://www.instagram.com/p/BDkz4qGPaBy/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-juice-haircuts/;Low Cut Fade with Tramline;The most outstanding and visible feature of this haircut is its tramline.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-juice-haircuts/;Shaped Afro Fade;Will Smith made the shaped   to be popular.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-juice-haircuts/;Juice Fade with Print;Just as Kanye West combines his juice fade with Aztec print, you can also do so with any other print of your choice.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-juice-haircuts/;Faded Half High Top;"A high top design is good; a half high top is better, but a half high top that fades is definitely the best. As you can see, a tramline cuts through one side of the head to make it shorter than the other (thus making it a half high top because only one side achieves the full height).";http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Faded-Half-High-Top.jpg;Faded Half High Top;https://www.instagram.com/p/6T0NR8EIDM/

http://machohairstyles.com/best-juice-haircuts/;Juice Fade with Color;Another modification to your traditional juice fade is the addition of color. The best way to do it is by adding a color that suits your skin tone and to the un-tapered part of your hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Juice-Fade-with-Color-650x812.jpg;Juice Fade with Color;https://www.instagram.com/p/BDgluWtk2lz/

http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;Ask a Friend to Help;Before you start making your hair, it is crucial to decide the size that you want because it might not be possible to get your natural hair back once you make the locks. The thickness of dreads can be anything between half an inch and one inch, but a few people often have theirs thicker or thinner than this. If you go with thick dreads, then you will have fewer locks on your head, and so they will also be easier to make. Thicker ones also become compact faster than thin ones, but their greatest disadvantages are that there are harder to brush back when you change your mind, and they are also complicated to maneuver when you want to wear different styles. However, it is important to know that the thickness of the locks will also depend on your hair type. For example, men with thinning hair will only look good in thick ones since their hair makes it hard for them to get thin locks even if they want.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Decide-on-the-Size-of-the-Locks.jpg;Decide on the Size of the Locks; 
http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;Prepare Your Hair;If you decide to dread yourself, then you should be prepared for a tedious task as it is quite a job. In fact, if you do it alone it would take you the entire day if not longer depending on the volume and length of your hair. The difference between creating the dreadlocks yourself and having a professional do it is the fact that the stylist has more experience than you. Some even have special equipment that will help them get the job done fast. And so if you want to have some neat and uniform dreads soon you should ask a friend or two to come help. You should not worry about the outcome because the locks are very easy to make, and anyone can give perfect ones once they figure out how to do them. Apart from getting a couple of friends to help it is also important to find a place that you will be comfortable to seat for a couple of hours so as to avoid any back pains later on.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ask-a-Friend-to-Help.jpg;Ask a Friend to Help;https://www.instagram.com/p/8lSs5mBA0Z/
http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;Brush to Remove Tangles and Knots;You should only dread your hair when it is clean and dry contrary to what some people think. It does not have to be sparkling clean, but you should have at least washed it a couple of days before. There is a common belief that dreads should be done on dirty hair as the dirt helps them become compact faster, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Working with dirty and greasy hair not only makes your task more difficult but can also prevent your dreadlocks from forming well, and it will also take longer. To prepare it well you should shampoo it two or more hours before but avoid the conditioner as it will not help you in any way. After washing, you should towel dry or let it air dry. Note that at the preparation stage is also where you should also get rid of any other hairdos that you may have for example braids.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ask-a-Friend-to-Help-1.jpg;Ask a Friend to Help;https://www.instagram.com/p/BArwKQVOK40/
http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;Section Your Strands;Brushing the hair may look like the complete opposite of what you want to achieve, but it is also a vital step in getting the dreads. Even when you go to a professional to have your dreadlocks, the stylist will always brush it before working on it. Brushing will make it easy to separate and also to section your strands, and so you should not skip this step. Although it is advisable not to use hot tools on your hair, sometimes it might be necessary to blow dry the hair to make it straighter and hence even easier to work with. Getting rid of the tangles also ensures that you get neat dreads.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Prepare-Your-Hair.jpg;Prepare Your Hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/-_FNCqRvER/
http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;Backcomb and Twist the Section;Sectioning the hair is one of the trickiest steps in wearing dreadlocks because you have to get the sections right in size and shape as this will determine how the locks will look. For most people one or two inches square sections will create amazing dreadlocks, and so you should also go with these sizes to get the best results. When sectioning the hair, you should start with the underside of your hair and work your way to the front. There are two ways that you can go about this step. The first one is to secure each section with a rubber band after separating it from the rest of the hair and do this until you finish the entire head. You can also create dreads with each section after sectioning so that by the time you finish dividing all the hairs you will also be through with making the dreadlocks.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Prepare-Your-Hair-1.jpg;Prepare Your Hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAKkEegrra3/

http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;Palm Rolling;If you want to know how to do dreads then you have to understand what backcombing and twisting is and how to do them. After sectioning the hair into one or two inches boxes, the next step and probably the most important one is creating the dreads. Backcombing is just one of the many ways of creating dreads, but it is the most widely used because the hairs look like dreadlocks on the same day you make them, and they also mature faster than when using other techniques. To backcomb your sectioned hair, you should use a dread comb to comb the sectioned hair backward starting, at least, an inch or closer to the scalp. You should backcomb a few strands at a time and eventually the hair will begin to build up at the roots. Although it is not necessary to twist the hair, it will be helpful if you can roll the strands that you are holding as you continue to backcomb. Continue backcombing while making sure that the hair is as tight as possible and once you reach the end secure the new lock with a rubber band and put another at the root to help it also remain in place at the base.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Brush-to-Remove-Tangles-and-Knots-1.jpg;Brush to Remove Tangles and Knots;

http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;Style the New Locks;You should repeat the backcombing and twisting process above for all the sections and tie each new dread with two rubber bands before you can wax the hair. Before you get to the waxing, you should ensure that all the sections are tightly in place. Waxing is simpler than backcombing but equally important as it helps in taming rogue strands and aids in the faster maturity of the dreadlocks created. To wax the hair, take a small amount and work it between your fingers to soften it or remove any clumps. You should then apply it to the backcombed sections starting from the roots and working your way to the tips. It is important to use a little at a time to avoid creating a waxy mess on your locks as you can always add some more in case the wax is not enough. Choosing the right wax type is important to get a good hairdo. You should go for good brands and avoid anything with petroleum.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dread-Comb.jpg;Dread Comb; 
http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;Dry Your Dreads;Once you have your sectioned hair backcombed and waxed the next step is palm rolling. Since the hair already looks good after the waxing, most people will skip this step especially given the fact that they are exhausted from all the work done so far, but this is not such a wise idea. It does not take a lot of time to palm roll, and so if you want a perfect look, you should take the time to do it or have your friends do it for you. Starting at the roots, you should briskly roll your newly created dreadlocks between your hands to the end. Repeat this for all the locks to give them a beautiful finish.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Backcomb-and-Twist-the-Section-1.jpg;Backcomb and Twist the Section;http://dreadstop.tumblr.com/post/109295534641/httpdreadstopcompalm-rolling-guide-dreadlocks

http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;Condition Your Dreadlocks;If it is your first time to wear dreadlocks and you have never even done them for a friend, then you will probably not get things right the first time. It is very understandable especially with the first few sections as your hands get used to this or before you master the pattern. And so once you finish palm rolling the hair you should go through all the sections to ensure that everything looks beautiful. The chances are that you will find a couple of portions that are loose even after waxing and although you might be tempted to palm roll as this is easier you should redo it again from the backcombing stage. Provided you were keen enough when working on the hair very few of them will be loose if at all any. And so to ensure that you get the best dreads, backcomb the loose ones then wax them again but make sure they do not become too waxy. Redoing some section will help you create some outstanding dreadlocks.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Palm-Rolling.jpg;Palm Rolling;

Although there are many available out there the best ones and also, the most useful ones are the ones that you make at home. It might look easier to buy one and just apply to your hair but by doing so, you will be losing out on many nutrients that are essential for hair growth. The packaged hair masks might smell and look better, but they usually have some preservatives, fragrance and also some colorants. Instead of going for these processed products you can make a simple but very effective mask at home with aloe and egg white. And apart from the many benefits that it will offer you, it is also pretty easy to make, and it only takes a couple of minutes. The aloe should be fresh, but if you cannot find it, then a bottled one that is 100% pure will also work. Blend the two together and you have a perfect mask that has been used for centuries to add moisture to the hair, give it a healthier appearance and most importantly to stimulate growth.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Use-an-Aloe-and-Egg-White-Mask.jpg;Use an Aloe and Egg White Mask; 
http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-get-long-hair/;A Hot Oil Massage Is Also Beneficial;When most men are trying to keep a long hair what they are more focused on is the strands and often forget that growing hair starts from the roots. Taking good care of the roots and the scalp is as important as anything else that you do to your locks to aid in growth if not more important. If the hair is healthy as it starts to grow then, it will get longer fast, and you will have very few split ends. One of the best ways to take care of the scalp is through a hot oil massage however you still have to choose the right oils if you want to stimulate growth. The best for this are olive, argon or coconut oil. You should heat up the oil and gently rub it into your scalp for about ten minutes and leave it to soak the hair for about half an hour. After this, you should finish by rinsing off with some warm water.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/A-Hot-Oil-Massage-Is-Also-Beneficial.jpg;A Hot Oil Massage Is Also Beneficial;http://www.myhealthtips.in/2013/06/20-ways-to-prevent-hair-loss-in-men.html

Shampoos are perfect for getting read of dirt and all the other hair products that you use such as gel or pomade, but it also takes away valuable natural oils that keep the hair healthy and soft. When this happens the mane†becomes fragile and unhealthy, and so it will not only stop growing fast, but this also leads to breakages. To avoid the problems that come with the use of shampoo you should limit its use to two or three times a week and also, use conditioner every time you use it. Conditioner helps to replace the proteins and lipids in the hair shaft and seal the cuticles against any further damage and hence ensuring that your hair grows longer and healthier.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Limit-the-Use-of-Shampoo.jpg;Limit the Use of Shampoo;https://www.instagram.com/p/_7b9sQicUT/?taken-by=longhairandbuns

Things, like staying too longer under the direct sun or swimming in a chlorinated pool, can ruin your hair. If you plan to be out in the sun for long you should not just carry sunscreen for your face but also a scarf or hat to cover your hair.

Hair products will affect directly everything that influences how long the hair grows and so if you make the wrong decision it will be hard to get those long locks. For the shampoo, you should avoid those that have silicone. Instead, you should go for those that use natural ingredients without any silicone, and the same should apply when buying your conditioner. Go for a conditioner with natural ingredients and the leave-in ones are better. For things like gel and any other styling product you should also only chose those with natural ingredients. However, the best thing is to avoid the use of these styling products when you can because you will hardly find any that does not have chemicals.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Avoid-Cotton-Pillowcase.jpg;Avoid Cotton Pillowcase;https://www.instagram.com/p/-9T3uICcWa/

Hair dyes are all made out of chemicals whether they are permanent or†semi-permanent. It is crucial to understand that your locks†and chemicals do not mix well and so when dying the hair you are usually making a compromise between long healthy hair and a beautiful appearance. The chemical damage caused by bleaching and coloring is immense, and there is usually no other way to bring back your hair to its original state except for cutting it. And so if you keep on coloring your locks you will always be forced to cut them down after some time, and this will limit the growth. Even simple things like highlights have the same effect, and so you should also avoid them.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Almond-and-Coconut-Oil-Mask.jpg;Almond and Coconut Oil Mask;https://www.instagram.com/p/4ZbE4qsVmQ/

However, as much as you do not like it you should ensure that you do it right for your strands can grow. First you should not brush wet hair as this will lead to breakages. Wet hair is fragile and so when you brush it you risk losing many strands. You should take a few minutes to towel dry your hair gently before brushing. Also, choose the right comb or brush for your hair by avoiding anything that has very hard bristles even if it can get the job done faster. When it comes to untangling the hair you have to be very patient, or you will ruin the hair. Before you even start brushing, you should try to untangle the locks with your fingers as this reduces the risk of breakages. When brushing start from the bottom and work your way up.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Choose-Your-Products-Wisely-1.jpg;Choose Your Products Wisely;http://www.findhealthtips.com/how-to-comb-hair-men/

Rosemary is particularly very useful, and it has been widely used on hair for many years as it stimulates the hair follicles and adds some luster to your locks. And just like most other herbs it will encourage faster growth because it improves circulation. To use rosemary or any other herb you should prepare an infusion by steeping the herb in hot water for about 20 minutes. You should then use the rosemary infusion as a final rinse after shampooing and conditioning the hair, or you can also mix it in with the shampoo.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Choose-Your-Products-Wisely.jpg;Choose Your Products Wisely;https://www.instagram.com/p/3bzar8sViC/

They may be very effective when styling the hair, but the hot tools will cause you more damage than good, and they might stand between you and your ambitions to get long locks. Using hot tools on your hair whether it is short or long is abusing the hair and it will not only cause breakages but will prevent fast growth. What these tools do - they make the hair weak and damage the scalp and so your hair will just not grow and if it does it will not be uniform. If you must use some heat on your strands, you should not overdo it, and it is also recommended that you do it occasionally. And most importantly keep the temperatures as low as possible.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Do-Not-Color-or-Bleach.jpg;Do Not Color or Bleach;https://www.instagram.com/p/0QOKUEsVoi/
http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-get-long-hair/;Good Body Health;It's not by chance that people associate hair loss with stress because it can lead to hair thinning, breakage and also slow growth. To simply state it if you are always stressed up then you will have a difficult time getting the long hair that you desire. However, good mane†health is not all about staying stress-free because what you eat will also affect growth. Eating a balanced diet will help your locks grow long, but the best foods for this are those with B vitamin biotins such as salmon and avocado. Other healthy foods for the hair are sources of folate such as berries and whole grain, B12 foods like fish and dairy products and B6 such as kale and broccoli. Apart from eating a balanced diet, it is also important to avoid processed foods so as to maintain a healthy body and hence also faster hair growth. Regular exercising is also important in the maintenance of good health.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Brush-or-Comb-the-Right-Way.jpg;Brush or Comb the Right Way;https://www.instagram.com/p/-Wz6KaCcVB/
http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-get-long-hair/;Hair Washing Habits;Keeping your hair clean will not only make it look more attractive but is also an effective way of maintaining good hair health. Clean hair is also known to grow faster than a dirty one. However, if you do not wash it the right way you will lose all these benefits and probably also do more harm than good to your strands. As mentioned earlier on you have to choose the right shampoos and conditioner for your hair, but proper hair washing does not just stop at these two as there is way much more involved. For example, the water temperature and purity will affect the hair health directly and so you should be careful with them. Most men wash hair with hot water because they think that it will get rid of all the gel build up and any germs, and it also feels good on the scalp, but this is not beneficial to your strands. Washing hair regularly with hot water will lead to breakage and hence preventing your strands from growing long. The effect of hot water is very evident, and you can easily prove it by changing to cold water for a couple of weeks and see the difference. You should also not use too much shampoo or conditioner and neither should you wash the locks every day. In fact, it is recommended that you only wash your strands about three times a week. It may not look very hygienic, but it will help you get long locks within a shorter time. If you have issues with the greasiness that is a result of less washing, you should wear a hat for a couple of days so that the scalp can adjust and stop producing too much oil.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Herbs-Infusion.jpg;Herbs Infusion;https://www.instagram.com/p/_aA8ZOiceV/
http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-get-long-hair/;Drink Plenty of Water;The doctors recommend that you take about three liters of water per day to maintain a healthy body. Even if you do not like drinking too much water, or you just forget about it, you have to try harder and take as much water as possible to get a longer hair. The mane†is one of the things that show that your body does not have enough water because the strands will be dull and dry. Dull and dry strands are prone to breakage, and this is one of the main things that can prevent you from getting long locks. It goes to show that a few liters of water a day are just as important as using the right product and doing regular trims if you want long locks. If you have trouble drinking plain water, you can drink flavored water or green tea as they will serve the same purpose. However, you should avoid alcohol, caffeine and soda.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Herbs-Infusion-1.jpg;Herbs Infusion;https://www.instagram.com/p/3SGT_LR96I/

http://machohairstyles.com/best-slicked-back-hair-ideas/;V Shape Nape;If your hair is somehow hard and long, this could be the style you are looking for. Sides are shaven to a size less than two millimeters which increases towards the top. A head†part is swept back and bundled in a way whhere it forms a V shape from the front to the back.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-slicked-back-hair-ideas/;Shaved Sides;This is almost similar to the long tail. The top hair is designed into a pony tail and†main difference is an†undercut. Sides are shaven almost uniformly leaving a very small height like the size of fur. A beard†and the sideburns are also shaven. A smart cut is done on the front of each sides giving it a nice look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shaved-Sides.jpg;Shaved Sides;https://www.instagram.com/p/_YINx-S5T3/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-slicked-back-hair-ideas/;High Peak;This involves classic styling since different parts of the head are shaven in different sizes. A†top part is left with very long hair which decreases in height backwards. One on the†sides is also trimmed and completely shaven. A†sideburn height should be similar to the hair next to it forming a neat line downwards. The top is then swept back in a way it forms a high peak close to the forehead.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/High-Peak.jpg;High Peak;https://www.instagram.com/p/_RPA8rqWVn/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-slicked-back-hair-ideas/;Shaved Perfection;This style has the top part combed sideways to form a small bundle on top. A sideline cut is done which is about a centimeter wide. Beneath it, a small line of hair which is swept backward is left followed by a clean shave. That is the part next to the ears. It can be combined with a french mustache to look better.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shaved-Perfection.jpg;Shaved Perfection;https://www.instagram.com/p/7r8vPgKWUt/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-slicked-back-hair-ideas/;Disconnected Beards;In most of the above styles, a beard is†well connected with hair forming a smooth transition. However, in this cut, an†undercut is done in such a way that sides are completely shaven. Sideburns start from the point without hair and their†size increases in both height and breadth downwards. A†chin has the high volume of beards which is long and curled in a way. A beard is†also dyed to have a cream like color.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Disconnected-Beards.jpg;Disconnected Beards;https://www.instagram.com/p/43VNu2KWdE/

There are different types of hair products†with some being able to be used in any style and others for individual hair looks such as spiky and messy. Although the multipurpose gels work pretty well for hair that does not require much styling, the Axe Spiked Up Look Styling Patty has been developed mainly for men who want spikes.

In fact, if you walk around for a couple of hours and sweat the spikes will be gone but this is not the case with this gel from Axe. And the best thing is that it will be sufficient for any hair length between short and medium.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Krieger-S√É¬∂hne-Premium-Styling-Hair-Gel.jpg;Krieger + S√É¬∂hne Premium Styling Hair Gel;

When applying, it might feel like any other ordinary gel but after it dries in a couple of minutes that is when you get to see the magic that it does on your spikes. Unlike other products, it does not form a very hard layer and neither are the hairs too soft. The hold created is just enough to ensure that the style remains in place throughout the day.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-hair-gel-for-men/;Style Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel;There are many other hair stylers in the market, and they all claim to be the best. Although some work as they claim most others will always disappoint you as they do not meet your expectations. The manufacturer of this gel goes to a great extend to ensure that users are happy with the results that they get. Although there are others on the market that can also give a good hold what makes this one particularly special is its smooth non-greasy texture. Apart from the incredible style of the crown (or the head if you keep uniform length throughout) there is nothing else that will betray what you have applied it. The characteristic greasy appearance associated with other products is nonexistent here, and it is replaced by an incredible shine which†will make your strands livelier. When applying you only need to scoop a little with your fingertip and rub between the fingers to liquefy. On application, it folds into your locks nicely. A little goes a long way, and so you do not have to apply too much which can cause the ugly greasy appearance. However, you can apply a little more if you want a super hold.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Style-Sexy-Hair-Hard-Up-Gel.jpg;Style Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel; 
http://machohairstyles.com/best-hair-gel-for-men/;TIGI Bed Head B;This is one of the most talked about hair product currently on the market and just like any other item some love it, and some have issues with it. However, if you value self-grooming like most men do then chances are, you have used this product at some point. In spite of the debate which†has always been there about it, the only thing people seem to agree about is that it is very efficient in styling and holding the hair. Suavecito is a water soluble product that has all the fantastic qualities of the old fashion pomade and has been given a few extra ingredients and consistency for a firmer hold. The water-solubility also makes it easy to wash out as you only require water and a mild shampoo. Leaving some pomade on your hair will ruin it, and so any product that you use should be completely washable before you can make a fresh application. With this pomade, you can maintain a great hairstyle for a product which†has been made the old fashion way with some quality organic and natural ingredients;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/TIGI-Bed-Head-B.jpg;TIGI Bed Head B; 
http://machohairstyles.com/best-hair-gel-for-men/;K+S Premium Forming Cream for Men;The fact that it has been made the old fashion way makes it special because back then people only used natural ingredients to make products. Natural ingredients not only make the product work much better, but they also make the hair and scalp healthier. These ingredients are also beneficial in the prevention of dry scalp and dandruff and hence making a man look cleaner and more elegant. The other thing that makes this product special is that it can be used on both dry and wet hair and still give perfect results. However if you want a shinier result, it is recommended you use it on wet hair. It is important to note that with this pomade the hold will still be perfect regardless of whether you apply it to dry or wet hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KS-Premium-Forming-Cream-for-Men.jpg;K+S Premium Forming Cream for Men; 
http://machohairstyles.com/best-hair-gel-for-men/;L√¢¬Ä¬ôOreal Paris Studio Line Melting Gel;Some men have very fantastic strands that are thick, voluminous and hard enough. And so these men can wear any style that they wish even using the worst quality products and still look great. However, as age catches up, they will no longer have this privilege as the strands become thinner and more flyaway. And when this happens you need something reliable that can keep your design in place the whole day and the Clubman Styling Gel is the thing for you. This product has been designed for application on any hair, and so you can get an elegant hairdo using it whether you have thick locks or fragile strands. It works better than most that are currently on the market and just by applying a small dab you can be assured that your bangs will remain in place for the entire day or even longer if you wish. If you do not like very stiff hair, you only need to run a brush or comb through once the hair dries for a smoother finish. Even when you run a comb through it still holds the hair in place, but the difference will be that it does not glue together.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/L√¢¬Ä¬ôOreal-Paris-Studio-Line-Melting-Gel.jpg;L√¢¬Ä¬ôOreal Paris Studio Line Melting Gel; 
http://machohairstyles.com/best-hair-gel-for-men/;Suave Professionals Men Styling Paste;This hair styler works correctly for all hairs, and it will maintain the style throughout the day whether it is a slick back or any of the many crown designs. However, what makes it unique is that one bottle can last even up to one year for some men because you only need a small dab for a perfect finish. Even if you like to style the hair more than once a day the 16oz bottle will take you for several months. In the world of today, manufacturers do not design retail products that last for long because they want you to come back and buy more, so this makes Clubman not only special but also unique. The beautiful and non-overpowering fragrance will also make you smell like a man, and this is very different from other hair stylers. Although others have very nice smells most of the time, they are overpowering and can be disturbing if you prefer to use a generous amount. Clubman is different because the fragrance is mild which makes it manlier and also one of the best hair gel for men.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Suave-Professionals-Men-Styling-Paste.jpg;Suave Professionals Men Styling Paste;

http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;The Classic Undercut;The classic   is an early 1900's hairstyle, but it is very popular among the youths nowadays. It also happens to be one of the best styles Brad Pitt has ever rocked. However, in his version of the undercut the sides and back are not left as short as in other undercuts but one could still see it is an undercut. Brad also combines his classic undercut style with a side part for an elegant look. Few other male celebrities can pull this look as good as he does.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad-pitt-hairstyles_3-650x650.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/-nXusIw_cw/
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Short Messy Style;Short messy hair is a great style especially when you want to wear a casual look and Brad likes to wear it from time to time. He wore this cut in Oceans 11, and he looked pretty good in it. The messy short style involves trimming the hairs in a uniform size with the front hairs being made slightly longer than the back and sides. The hair is then made messy with the fingers, and a styling product is used to hold the style for longer.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_41-650x976.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://sites.google.com/site/seourpicz/1/celebrities-and-entertainment-news/ar/1/brad-pitt-5
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Short Straight - Casual;The short casual straight style that Brad wears often proves that he is the undisputed king of versatility when it comes to hair styling. The sides and back in this style are cut short then blended in with the jagged cut top part. For this style, all you need is a little molding cream or gel to control and hold the style in place.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_6-.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/csW67HwOik/
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Short Straight - Formal Look;This style is perfect for any occasion. The idea behind it is to look nice and neat. In this style, Brad has the sides smoothed back up. The area around the ears is also made smooth to give the hair edges a clean finish. The top should also be left long to make it easy to comb back for a formal look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_61-650x975.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;http://www.fansshare.com/gallery/photos/12095385/brad-pitt-seven-years-in-tibet/?displaying

http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;The Buzz Cut;Brad Pitt has worn the spiky short hair on many occasions, but the most famous one is when he wore it in the movie Fight Club. Although this cut was more famous in the 90's if you consider how good he looked in the short spikes, then he would still stand out today with the same style. In this style, the short spikes are left in the top section of the hair while the sides and back were trimmed and swept to the sides.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_81-650x965.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles; 
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Feathered Look Long Hairstyle;Buzz cuts are easy styles to wear as all one needs to do it is to cut the hair very close to the scalp. However, not every man can look great in the   but as usual, Brad manages to pull this look when he wore it on Oceans 11. What makes him look great in a buzz cut is his face shape and hair texture. This cut needs almost no maintenance at all, and so it would be suitable for men who do not like spending many minutes each morning on the mirror working on their hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_8.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/-hYO-TP_Xr/
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Brad Pitt√¢¬Ä¬ôs Pompadour;In this style, the long hair is jagged cut to give a man a light and feathered look. It is a style that is best suited for men with fine and   that like casual hairstyles. This style should also be worn by men with   as it looks best on them. Regular trims are necessary to prevent split ends, and some products will be needed to hold and give the hair some shine.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_91-650x911.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;http://fanon.wikia.com/wiki/File:Brad-pitt-wallpaper-171.jpg
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Medium Length Slicked Back;Brad's closely shaved   is a hairstyle that you are likely to see more on the streets because he is a trendsetter and his fans are always waiting for him to come up with a style they can copy. The cut in this style leaves, at least, two inches of hair in the crown. This makes it possible for the hair to be brushed back. Sides are blade shaved while the back has a much softer fade. Styling gel is applied to wet the hair, and then it is brushed back with a comb then it is air dried to finish the look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_101-650x650.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://coreynhowell.wordpress.com/2015/03/16/whats-up-with-brad-pitts-hair-in-killing-them-softly/
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Short with Tapered Sides;Even if you were to lawnmower Brad Pitt's hair, he would still look good. The medium hair length slicked back that he wore in the movie Troy proves this. In this film all, he had to do with his hair is to comb it backward without doing anything else. The only other notable thing in this style is the blonde hair color but even without this, he would probably still look great in the hairstyle.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_111-650x433.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;http://confitdent.com/brad-pitt-achilles-troy-workout-and-diet/

In this style, the hair is tapered into a longer top part while the sides are chipped in for a textured finish. It is an incredible style for guys with thinning hair as it can add some volume to their hair and it suits most face shapes including oblong and square.";http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_13.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;

This cut is so popular that it has even been nicknamed the ""Fury Hairstyle"". Fury hairstyle is a variation of the World War 2 undercut. What makes it different from other undercuts is that it is less conservative than other undercuts and hair stylists and experts have described it as an extreme undercut. To get the cut all, you need to do is to go extreme with your undercut and maintain a proper length at the top.";http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_14-.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/-hWTkrP_Te/
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Waved Out;A few years ago Brad Pitt decided to go all blonde with his hair. It was during a time when he had a wavy long hair and so to spice things up he dyed it blonde. Blonde is a naturally occurring hair color, but it looks best on men with thick, voluminous hair such as Brad Pitt's and so you can tell that he knew he would look good even before trying this style. He then paired it with a well-kept beard for an eye-catching look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_151-650x897.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/adzQYVQOtx/
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;The Man Bun;The borderline mullet is one of the most requested hairstyles of all time, and so it was only fair for Brad Pitt to try it because he likes to experiment with hair. However, unlike other styles he has worn in the past, this one does not go well with his hair type and facial features. The borderline mullet gives him a look that he should only wear for a role in a movie.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_162.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;http://www.celebitchy.com/157182/brad_pitt_mullet-y_in_all-white_tree_of_life_was_booed_at_cannes/
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Red Tone Brad;Brad Pitt was all waved out when he received his Golden Globe award in 1996. He paired this hairstyle†with a nice suit to finish an elegant look that left people talking for weeks. The short but very nice waves on his head made his hair look more textured and voluminous, and he had a slight and almost invisible part at the center of the head. This slight parting gave some direction to the front waves while the   was also slightly slicked back.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_17.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/dQoZvmwOjL/?taken-by=bradpittoficial
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Shampoo Commercial Coif;It is rare to see Brad in a man bun nowadays. He seems to have preferred having it in his younger years, but we will probably see him wear it again at some point in the near feature. His simple man bun pulls the hair together just like any other bun, but he likes to tie his hairs into a bun at a lower position that the traditional man's buns.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_18.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/-Yx67WnI8j/

http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Brad√¢¬Ä¬ôs Side Part;Hair colors are a good way to add some style and class to your hair, but the secret behind a good look is choosing the right color. Brad Pitt proved that this was true when he decided to go all red with a red hair tone. This style looked fantastic on him especially given the fact that he had a short nicely trimmed hair that had a longer length on top. And his choice of red was also right because it was not too light and neither was it too dark.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_201-650x830.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles; 
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;The Slicked Back;The shampoo coif that Brad had in 2012 shows that his hair styles just get better with age. The coif is very straightforward, and there is nothing very fancy about it, but it still makes him look good. Its simplicity makes it an easy style to replicate, and all that you will need to wear this style is a long hair (at least shoulder length) and some quality shampoo.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_212-650x818.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;http://www.becauseiamfabulous.com/2012/10/15/brad-pitt-chanel-no-5-campaign/

Brad's stylist seems to have got things right with his piecey hairstyles as it was nothing short of perfect. To make the already good style even better, it is given a platinum color and a slight side part with the front hairs swept in opposite directions to finish a perfect piecey platinum look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_222-650x747.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.pinterest.com/pin/31173422397954680/

In this style, he goes simply with a side part on a medium sized hair. The hair is then swept on one side to finish the side-part look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_24-650x650.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;

http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;The Clean Shave;Brad likes to slick back his hair even when wearing different styles but in this style, the slick back is the main style. The hair is trimmed to a medium length then some smoothening product is applied to it. To finish the look, the hair slicked back with a brush. This style is suitable for all types of face shapes and medium to  , but men with extended foreheads may not want to wear it as it will expose it more.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_26.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles; 
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Feathered Fringe;Bobs do not only look good on women and Brad proved this when he wore a relaxed Bob in September 2011. The relaxed bob blended in well with his facial features. The center hair parting and slick back in the style make his face look more symmetrical. And so this style will be suitable for men with oval, triangular and square face shape.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_271-650x921.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/-fn9qNkD7b/
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Brad√¢¬Ä¬ôs Manly Moustache Look;Pitt pulled the smooth operator look back in 2004 and ever since then he has tried dozens of different hairstyles, but it remains to be one of his all-time best a decade later. This style involves a side parted hair that is swept smoothly to the side. A good hair product has to be used to make the hair smooth. This is because smooth hair is the center of attraction in this style. If you are thinking of wearing this style, then you should also maintain a proper length at the top.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_28-650x650.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/-hXpgcv_WQ/
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;The Flowing Locks;It's hard to tell what Brad natural hair looks like because every style that he wears looks natural on him, and so the curly hair is no exception. Brad has worn the curly hair in two distinct ways. In the first style, he wore a long textured curly hair that had what looked like a side parting. In the second style, the hair is shorter, and the sides and back are closely trimmed and a longer curly hair left at the top section of the head. In both styles, the superstar looked fantastic and, for this reason, many people have tried to copy the two styles.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_29-650x650.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;http://www.nicehair.org/car-category/brad-pitt-hair-styles-which-is-best-vote-here
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Sophisticated Soul Patch;This is one of the simplest styles that Brad has worn over years. It involves a medium length hair that is brushed back with a comb. What made this style more appealing on Brad's head is the appearances of some patches of the gray hairs on his head. This style is suitable for men in their early fifties whose hair color has started to change due to age. To wear these style just keep medium hair length and comb it back.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_30.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/vCjgo7QOtx/
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Blond Tips;The clean shave hair moment is about the beard and not the hair on Brad Pitt's head. What makes it an attractive hairstyle is the fact that it is rare to see Brad with a clean shaved beard and with not a single trace of hair on his face. Lack of hair on his face helps to draw more attention to his hairstyles that in most cases are a neatly cut short hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_31-650x782.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;http://www.eigazin.com/human/52.html
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;The Massive Beard Look;The feathered fringe is a fabulous hairstyle that makes the hair look and feel lighter. This medium length haircut involves a lot of scissors trimming especially at the back with the top hair being left long enough to cover the forehead all the way to the eyebrows. A feathered fringe look is a more casual or outdoor look that Brad wore in 2010. It goes well with any hair type, but thick hairs will look better as they are easier to work with.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_32-650x520.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/-jgO8tP_fo/
http://machohairstyles.com/all-brad-pitt-hairstyles/;Sun-in/Mullet Combo;A mustache is a must have to complete a gentleman look at least according to men who like wearing one. In late 2014 Brad Pitt pulled an impressive look with a manly mustache. His hair was nicely shaped into what looked like an incomplete pompadour while his face was cleanly shaved except for the manly mustache. Although this look made Brad look older, he still looked good, and many fans probably copied the style.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_332-650x928.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/9SG1DIwOiz/

However, a couple of years back he had some nice flowing locks. Back in 1993 Brad had some luscious flowing locks and he looked nice in them especially given the fact that he also had a short well-trimmed beard to go with the locks.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_341-650x894.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;https://www.instagram.com/p/mVhggUwOmm/

Brad tried this idea with his short brush back hair in 2007. His brush back hair was just okay but not outstanding. What made the style stand out was the blond tips but they could hardly be noticed if one was not keen enough. Looking at this style, you will know there is something special about it, but you will only notice the blonde tips if you look close enough.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_37.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles;

His hair was a medium length slicked back that looked quite nice, but the massive and somewhat shaggy beard drew all the attention from his neat hair. However, this style did not last as he was back to his traditional mullet within no time.

To make styling even much easier, you should keep the sides short but make sure that they are not shaved too close to exposing the scalp as this will ruin the look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_8.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/-_SS8EEstP/
http://machohairstyles.com/hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;Spiky Perfection;All types of locks†can be textured and made spiky, but naturally thick hair has an edge over the rest because it holds the spikes much better than other hair types even without using any products. In this cut, the spiky mane†at the top is combined with well shaped facial hairs that go very well with the hairstyle.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_9.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/--GDGghM8v/
http://machohairstyles.com/hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;Simple but Elegant Thick Hair;The beauty of this hairstyle is a result of only two things that are the thickness of the hair and the skills of the barber. This style fits perfectly on men with round and oval face shape and the thicker the mane, the better they will look because it will be easier to get the styling right. The hairstyle also proves that you can never go wrong if you choose a skilled and experienced barber to work on your strands.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_10.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/-1hxzdEyT5/
http://machohairstyles.com/hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;Perfectly Messy Cut;There are many ways to get a messy look and just like this cut most of them involve clean shaved sides and back to ensure that all the attention remains at the top locks. Although the cut in this hairstyle is similar to other messy haircuts†the styling is perhaps what makes it distinct and unique. What is more interesting is that only pomade wax is used to achieve this gorgeous look, and no blow drying is required. A clean shaved face also adds some value to this hairstyle.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_11.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/-KzHteIzHM/
http://machohairstyles.com/hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;The Eclipse Cut;This hairstyle is for confident men who are willing to go the extra mile and experiment with their mane. However, this cut is still not as extreme as others, and it involves thick hair at the top that is trimmed to about three inches, styled and slightly swept to the side. The sides are then faded, but what gives it uniqueness is the distinct line introduced on one side just a few inches before the ear. It looks like a parting line but it is created in an area with little hair and so the line itself is the center of attraction and not what it does to the hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_12.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/9XQqT3IzOE/
http://machohairstyles.com/hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;Long Bangs Styled Backwards;Most men are used to styling their long bangs forward, but this is not the only way you can make them look good.

http://machohairstyles.com/hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;The Disconnected Messy Top;This is another amazing hairstyle where the gel or any other product does most of the work. In this messy hairstyle, the top is longer than what you would find in medium and short  . The front locks†should be long enough to cover the forehead just slightly. You should then style the hair forward using a quality gel or pomade. For the cut, you should create a disconnection with the sides and back by closely shaving these areas and also with a clean shaved face.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_15.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/6q0Z-wozFr/

The hair should then be blow-dried and finished with good quality pomade.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_16.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/50ySmmIzPf/

This style needs almost no cut at all except for slight trimming to level up the hair. You can then style the locks†by side parting and pushing a portion of them†to one side.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_17.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/---vp0F7su/
http://machohairstyles.com/hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;The Winter Tapers;It's all about the layers in this cut. Some skillful tapering is done on the hair to give it the distinct layers and to make them more visible. Undercuts are also done on the sides and the back of the head to finish the look. However, to wear the winter tapers the most important part is tapering and so you should choose a barber that is skilled at this. You can also add some color to the top layers and style them frontwards to finish the look.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_18.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/-opNXsuuVN/
http://machohairstyles.com/hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;Modern Textured Tops;The modern texture top haircut involves a messy and spiky top that is textured with pomade and styled frontwards. However, it should be styled with the fingers so that the messy and spiky look of the mane†can be maintained.

http://machohairstyles.com/hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;The Combover with a Beard;For this hairstyle, the only thing that you will need is a comb and a quality hair product to hold the style and to maintain good hair health because everything else is natural. This style is worn on a medium size hair and fully grown beard. The hair is then combed back after the application of the gel or pomade. It looks particularly attractive on men whose thick hair is changing color due to age but to get the same effect you can dye your hair with one or a few colors.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_20.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/-9mbWUPEZm/

In this style, the mane†is very natural and no cut is needed at all, and you can let it†flow freely in its natural locks or pull it together in a man bun. However, it looks best if the hair is blonde and so some color might be necessary if your mane†is not naturally blonde.

The mane†starts with a simple and neat design†on the crown, but things get crazy with the introduction of the long blue locks that are styled to face upwards.

Just by looking at it you can tell that it is very complicated and very hard to create. The web that forms the base is probably the easier thing in the cut†because the spider is quite detailed with its legs being formed through braiding.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Spider-on-the-web.jpg;Spider on the web;https://www.instagram.com/p/_Do2abl7kk/

You look like a celeb in this style.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Celebrity-Cut.jpg;Celebrity Cut;http://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/heres-a-song-dedicated-to-zac-efron-in-flaunt-magazine
http://machohairstyles.com/best-haircuts-for-round-faces/;Top Mop;This is a top style that even Leo DiCaprio tries it sometimes. It is combing the hair backward, but the top and sides are done to varying fineness. The sides are combed in such way that they are more refined and tucked below the top mop. At the top, the hair is combed with a not-so-fine comb hence leaving it bumpy and with some tangles. It is a top style that will for sure keep you distinctive even in huge crowds.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Top-Mop.jpg;Top Mop;http://www.esquire.com/the-side/qa/dicaprio-interview-0310

http://machohairstyles.com/best-haircuts-for-round-faces/;Cave Forehead;This is yet another timeless style that will be a good complement to your round face. The sides are shaved to the point where the head drop begins. From the back hairline, a patch begins to form and keep rising towards the front. The ascension continues to the top until it reaches the front hairline. At the front, a tip is pulled beyond the face to form what appears as a cave. It is an outstanding style that will give you a cool appearance and score highly with the ladies.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Cave-Forehead.jpg;Cave Forehead;https://www.instagram.com/p/-_sW_zR51w/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-haircuts-for-round-faces/;Parted Bundles;Here the hair is divided into three patches: the top and two sides. They are all divided by clear drawn lines at both sides of the forehead. The side bundles are combed downwards and appear to be thinning towards their ends. The top bundle is combed to form a rounded heap with a flat top.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Parted-Bundles.jpg;Parted Bundles;https://www.instagram.com/p/-w4cuhR58v/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-haircuts-for-round-faces/;Wild-Tangled Top;You pull a sophisticated look with a thick top that seems to have defied any recent cuts. The wild tangled top is one way to give you such sophistication. The low sides are shaved clean and succeeded with a layer an inch long. The top is not trimmed unless it is too long to give a contained appearance. The top patch is combed towards the front, and the tangles are allowed to make turns into the inside once they reach your fore line.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Wild-Tangled-Top.jpg;Wild-Tangled Top;https://www.instagram.com/p/_gYqtbuudj/

The lower sides are shaved clean and then followed with a layer between 0.5-1 inches. The top should never be trimmed but only combed backwards. It creates an effect that the middle layer is dissolved into the longer upper patch.";http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Backwards-Undercut.jpg;Backwards Undercut;https://www.instagram.com/p/_W0ZJzuuSr/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-haircuts-for-round-faces/;Slight Top Sweep;A sweep does not have to be from medium or long hair. You can have your desire for a sweep achieved even with short hair. The sides are trimmed to be shorter than the top. You can then decide on the side to slightly tilt your top to create a sweeping appearance. This is a style that brings out your mustache and taming the roundness of your face.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Slight-Top-Sweep.jpg;Slight Top Sweep;https://www.instagram.com/p/_OZCmQuuVC/
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Short Full Beard; does not always have to be very long to look fabulous because it is neatly trimmed short it can look outstanding on any man. The trick to getting splendid short full facial hairs†is to let the hair grow as long as possible before trimming it short. Letting the hair grow long will ensure that you have enough hairs on the face to make the†style†full. If you try to wear the look†on a short stubble, you are more likely to have some patches with very short or non-uniform hairs.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_2.jpg;beard styles; 
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;The Close Shave;This is an attractive style, but people that do not understand it†would argue that it is not a beard look†since there is no clear style. However, it qualifies to be called a close shave, and it is also very common. This look†involves shaving the facial hair†very close but not to a clean level. Subtle hairs should still be visible on the face, and the hair should be uniform in size. The level of the facial hair should make a man look like he has gone for a couple of days without a shave. This cut is suitable for men who love beards but do not want to maintain very long ones.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_3.jpg;beard styles;https://www.instagram.com/p/_ELkhZQweH/
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Almost Hipster†Look;A   is used to finish the   look, and it can enhance any hairstyle. However, this style comes short of the hipster look†because despite having most of the characteristics of this type of beard it is not shaggy. The facial hair†appears well trimmed and combed, but it is grown in the same way as the hipster facial hairs. A mustache is also maintained, and it has to be trimmed to blend in with current†style.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_4.jpg;beard styles;https://www.instagram.com/p/_CST1eAfB-/
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Short and Nicely Colored;Just as in the case with the hair, some color can make the facial hairs look splendid, and you need not overdo the cut or styling as the color does everything for you. However, the trick is in the choice of the color to use. For this style to look good go for natural hair colors such as brown, black or some red tones and make sure that the color you choose can blend in with your strands†color. The facial hairs should also be neatly trimmed short and well groomed for this style to look good on you.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_5.jpg;beard styles;https://www.instagram.com/p/_D12-xMP3m/
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Well Trimmed Beard and a Bald Head;The bald head is an important element in this style as it helps to shift more attention to the neatly trimmed long facial hairs. More beauty is added to this style by the fact that the beard appears to grow in a wavy pattern and besides from being well trimmed it is also outlined well with a razor and some quality product used on it.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_6.jpg;beard styles;http://o-u-t-l-a-w-z.tumblr.com/post/29000776337
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Braided Long Beard;To wear this style you have to keep a very long beard, and this means that you should not shave it for a couple of months or even years. However, if you already have a long facial hair†then to wear this style you should weave it into two   on the chin. You can shave or trim the rest of it†to make the two braids your†center of attraction.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_7.jpg;beard styles;https://www.instagram.com/p/9_upEPRyQj/
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Mustache with Faded Beard;Chin strip can be worn on any face shape but the one combined with a mustache is best suited for men with a diamond face shape. The mustache brings about balance in the diamond face shape and hence creating a more attractive look. For this style, the beard should be kept short but on the same level with the mustache.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_8.jpg;beard styles;https://www.instagram.com/p/_EKBH4zTmC/
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;The Short Stubble;Short stubble is arguably one of the easiest styles to wear as it can be achieved by letting the hair go for a few days without being shaved. To maintain this look, you should use a trimmer, but you have to make sure that the guard in the trimmer is set all the way back. The hairs below the Adam's apple should be razor shaved.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_9.jpg;beard styles;https://www.instagram.com/p/_EJ2OdgWgy/
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Medium Long and Well Groomed;With beards sometimes all you have to do is to groom it and it will look splendid. In this style, a medium length is maintained, and more attention is focused on grooming the facial hairs. Since the facial hair†is full, you can leave it as it is or trim it to give it a uniform size. However, the most important thing is to use some quality products to give it a spark.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_10.jpg;beard styles;https://www.instagram.com/p/_DXvnRmVO8/
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;The Viking Style;Viking style is extreme because it†should cover a large portion of the face. In this look, the mustache is also let to overgrow, and little trimming is done on the hair. The only noticeable cuts done on the facial hairs are the ones used to make it uniform. To grow this type of beard, you will require a lot of patience. However, to start it off just let your stubble†grow for about a month and then you can start shaping them while limiting any cuts that reduce the size.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_11.jpg;beard styles;https://www.instagram.com/p/_C272lGdb-/
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Chin Strip and a Mustache;Chin strip looks great on round and oval faces, and they are also easy to style for men whose facial hairs grow in a certain pattern. As the name suggests having this beard requires hairs growing in a strip on your chin and you should pair this with a neat mustache to complete a gorgeous bold look.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_12.jpg;beard styles;https://www.instagram.com/p/-9q4C0yiMV/
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Goatee and Mustache;These styles combine an awesome   and a   to create a look that can be both casual and formal. To make sure that the goatee and mustache are the main centers of attraction the rest of the facial hairs should be cleanly shaved. A mustache is easy to grow since most men naturally have it, but the goatee may be a little tricky to keep because not all facial hairs can grow in this pattern.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_13.jpg;beard styles;https://www.instagram.com/p/-8DOeaqmt5/
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Extra Long Goatee with†French Mustache;The extra long goatee is a very popular   in the Japanese culture, but this look†adds some spice to it by combining it with an extra long French mustache. Even though the mustache looks over-sized, it still makes a great style, and any man that is bold enough and can keep a very long goatee and mustache should try it.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_14.jpg;beard styles;http://www.modernsalon.com/inspiration/portfolio/40-beard-and-mustache-looks-2014-championship
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Short and Natural;Keeping your stubble†short and natural is sometimes all you need to get a gorgeous look. In this style, it†is enhanced by the neat chin hairs that almost look like a goatee and the decent mustache. The beard is then roughly scissor trimmed to give a shaggy but still natural look. It is important not to cut the facial hair†too short because the shorter it is the less natural it will look, and it will portray visible signs of shaving.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_15.jpg;beard styles;http://mynewplaidpants.blogspot.com/2013/01/charlie-hunnam-eleven-times.html
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Sideburns, Mustache, and Short Stubble;Sideburns join the mane†to the facial hairs, and so they have a way of complementing each of the two types of hairs. In this style neatly shaved sideburns combine well with a short and well kept mustache and a short stubble style beard to create a unique look. To wear this style you only need to maintain thick sideburns that should be about three inches long and a small mustache. For the stubble, you should let your facial hairs go unshaven for a couple of days.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_16.jpg;beard styles;http://hypnopompiamag.com/post/129109419794
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Fully Grown Goatee;The fully grown out goatee is an incredible style and stands out due to its size. Although not all men can keep a goatee those who have it should wear this style by letting it grow beyond the ordinary short size that most men prefer to keep. It should then be slightly trimmed to maintain uniformity. This style seems to look better on men with white or gray hairs because these natural colors add a stylish appearance to an already fantastic beard.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_17.jpg;beard styles;http://gallery.airows.com/post/40099176223
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Professionally Short;Keeping a beard professional or formal is very easy as all you need to do is to keep it short. Contrary to what most people think you do not have to shave cleanly your face to wear a business†look. A short and neat stubble†also makes a professional look, and it can be worn for any formal occasion. The idea of this style is to keep the facial hair†to a level that it†would grow to if unshaven for a couple of days. A mustache will also be an added advantage for this style.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_18.jpg;beard styles;http://static.squarespace.com/static/521a85cfe4b09bd519e0470e/t/52cec237e4b0c18dd2d0e9f8/1389281849948/AW14-ETautz-0214-TB.jpg
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;French Mustaches and Medium Stubble;In this look, most people will probably not notice the medium stubble facial hair†because the mustache will take most of the attention. The huge French mustache that has been keenly shaped and styled totally changes the appearance of a man and so you have to be sure of the look you want to wear before choosing this style. Due to its size growing it will require a lot of patience and grooming, but for the medium stubble, things should be simpler as you can let your hair grow to this size after a shave or trim your long beard to this size.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_19.jpg;beard styles;https://twitter.com/blue01stylist/status/633606758800433152
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;All White and Extra Full;Full beards look amazing, but they look even much better if they are made extra longer. The longer the facial hair, the fuller it will look and if combed creatively then it creates an incredible look. In this style, things are taken a little further by the all white natural color and, of course, the mustache also spices up things more. As age catches up your facial hair†will change color, but younger men can also get this color for their beard by dying it.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_20.jpg;beard styles;http://www.modernsalon.com/inspiration/portfolio/40-beard-and-mustache-looks-2014-championship
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Extreme Beard and Mustache;Extreme beards and mustache give a man a villain or a Viking look, and it is a very popular style for bikers and men with a rebel attitude. Styling this type of stubble†is very simple as all that is needed is a good combing, but growing it is the tricky part as it has to be grown full and to an extreme length. However, a good way to start it off is by scrubbing your face to clear the path for your hair to grow. Eating a healthy diet and getting enough sleep have also been proven to aid in hair growth.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_21.jpg;beard styles;http://www.modernsalon.com/inspiration/portfolio/40-beard-and-mustache-looks-2014-championship
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Long and Wavy with Some Color;Some men are lucky enough to have a naturally wavy beard but even for those that do not have this type of facial hair there are many ways to make their long facial hair†wavy. The beard in this style should be long enough to touch at least the chest when combed and styled. Although it†will look just beautiful, styled it is a good idea to spice up by giving it some color. A red tone looks best on most men.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_22.jpg;beard styles;http://www.modernsalon.com/inspiration/portfolio/40-beard-and-mustache-looks-2014-championship
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;The Mutton Chops;The   are best suited for men with an oblong face shape because they bring balance to their face. Mutton chops join the mustache to the sideburns but what makes them a distinct style is the absence of hairs on the chin, or if present they are made shorter than the other facial hairs. To grow mutton chops, you should let your sideburns grow to the corners of your mouth while also keeping a mustache.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_23.jpg;beard styles;https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/474003929503434561/
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Van Dyke Style;Facial hairs do not grow in the same pattern for all men. Whereas some men are lucky enough for hairs to grow all over their face, some only have them†on the chin and mustache area. However, even without hairs all over the face a man can still style the stubble†on the chin and combine it with a mustache for a perfect Van Dyke look. The trick behind this style is to shave clean all the smaller hairs on the other part of the face if any to ensure that all attention remains on the chin strip and mustache.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_24.jpg;beard styles;https://www.birchbox.com/guide/slideshow/8-easy-style-leaps-to-take-in-2014
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-beard-styles/;Scissor Trim Perfection;This style demonstrates how a pair of scissors can change a man's look by giving his beard a perfect trim. Here the scissor does all the hard work, and so this style relies purely on the skills of your barber because all you have to do is grow the facial hair†to medium length. It is also an easy style to maintain through regular trimming. Since†it†is very short, you can also use a razor, but it will probably not look as good.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beard_styles_25.jpg;beard styles;https://www.instagram.com/p/-sKuOYge1t/
http://machohairstyles.com/adorable-baby-boy-haircuts/;Medium-Length Cut;If you are looking for something comfortable for your boy kid, then the medium length style will work its magic. The medium sized hair is parted with a short line on the left, and bigger chunk of hair goes to the right. You can leave it to run downwards but with little trims to keep it intact. This is a great style that will make him stand out from a crowd.†boy haircuts;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/baby_boy_haircuts_2.jpg;baby boy haircuts; 
http://machohairstyles.com/adorable-baby-boy-haircuts/;Pull-Up Style;It would be right to call it the little ones' style for afro, but this is way better for a small boy. The hair is left to grow upwards and sideways at equal lengths. You can give it a trim on the tips but better to grow it naturally. The good thing is that it can be both for medium and long hair. It makes your boy distinctive from the rest with a style that is not so common.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/baby_boy_haircuts_3.jpg;baby boy haircuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/84A1QqjcPH/
http://machohairstyles.com/adorable-baby-boy-haircuts/;Long Shaggy Cut;You can give your kid a†stardom look right from his early years. With this style, you can let his†strands†grow freely downwards: the back, sides and the forehead. Do not trim the edges but let them form natural curls. This is a style that would be best for your kid who is keen to keep their long hair. It is a bold look†that will give him confidence, and he will be the star of other small boys in your neighborhood or his school.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/baby_boy_haircuts_4.jpg;baby boy haircuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/_jVnUMviWb/

The hair is styled into simple zigzag-like locks starting from the hair on the top. You can shave the side locks†to almost an inch from the scalp. In other cases, you can let the strands†grow all over the entire head. It is best suited for kids with naturally curling hair, but you can also use gels to induce simple curls.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/baby_boy_haircuts_5.jpg;baby boy haircuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/_iziEmoQe7/
http://machohairstyles.com/adorable-baby-boy-haircuts/;Front Spiky Hairdo;This is yet another of the Mohawk styles but a mild one that will give your boy a confident and sweet look. Reduce the side hair to almost an inch from the scalp and comb it to lie low. The top center is left to grow upwards. If he does not have a curling hair, you can use styling gels to achieve the spike effect.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/baby_boy_haircuts_6.jpg;baby boy haircuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/_YeevNoQfq/

The curly style is the most natural style for him, so do not try haircuts that may spoil his look. Let his curls grow outwards and downwards. You can let it be soft or add some gel to make it look rough. Whichever of the two you choose; he will be a look to admire.";http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/baby_boy_haircuts_7.jpg;baby boy haircuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/_BJ7ReoQc4/
http://machohairstyles.com/adorable-baby-boy-haircuts/;Spikeless Mohawk;A real Mohawk may not be suitable for a young one, but if he insists that he wants that style, there is one for him. A spikeless mohawk is just close to the real thing, but it is not spiked at the top. The side hair is shaven to an inch length, and the top is left to grow but trimmed or grooved to give it a blunt edge. It achieves its effect, and your kid will love this even more.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/baby_boy_haircuts_8.jpg;baby boy haircuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/9pvwiPoQRJ/

You can add some gel to keep the two layers in their desired positions.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/baby_boy_haircuts_11.jpg;baby boy haircuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/9KJfGtBV1y/
http://machohairstyles.com/adorable-baby-boy-haircuts/;Single-Styled Undercut;This is a top style for your toddler. One side of the head is shaven clean (where the top hair will fall) while the other can be given a single stripe or a pattern you may find appealing. The top hair is set to fall to the side that has been cleared. This leaves an   on one side while the other shows off the draw pattern.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/baby_boy_haircuts_12.jpg;baby boy haircuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/_T-D6PFM43/

Trim the top to a medium size and let it rest naturally or add some touch by letting it grow towards the front. On the sides, make at most three stripes separated by a clean-shave thin line. Let the stripes end somewhere after the ear but not at the end of the back hairline.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/baby_boy_haircuts_13.jpg;baby boy haircuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/9YRycPlM3n/

This color brings about a perfect combination of gray and white hairs that are a result of genes or aging. It is also very stylish, and so you can wear it to enhance your look. It is suitable for cool and neutral complexions. Medium and coarse textured hairs also look best in this color, but you can always use it for any other type of hair provided you choose a good cut or hairstyle to go with it.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1530668_1662924810632669_412047771_n-650x650.jpg;hair color ideas;https://www.instagram.com/p/9u4bdqxdWH/

Blonde strands†look better on light skinned men or those with a cool complexion, and so the neutral blonde will also look good on males†with similar complexions. If you have dark brown eyes, this will be an added advantage for the look since this eye color will stand out against a dark blonde mane. The best hair texture for this color is medium because fine or too thick hair will not look very attractive.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12299055_527845174037217_517981920_n-650x650.jpg;hair color ideas;https://www.instagram.com/p/-o5U20yJ61/

A neutral complexion, in this case, means that you do not have underlying red or olive tones on your skin. This color works well with any strand†texture, but it is important to know that fine hair texture will look even finer in this color. And so a short spiky cut will look extra good when worn in this color.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12063173_746034248873891_924590213_n-650x650.jpg;hair color ideas;https://www.instagram.com/p/9Z8AFKQhaY/

Men with medium and fair complexions are the best candidates for the deep red hair color. However, men with warm and slightly darker skin tones can still wear this color, but the red tone they chose has to be deeper to make their hairs stand out. Thick and medium textured hair is probably the best for this color mainly because it forms a good base for the short cut that goes with deep red, but you should not let your hair texture prevent you from wearing this color. You can play along with different hairstyles till you get one that will go well with deep red.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12224428_1005524042844462_106673842_n-650x650.jpg;hair color ideas;https://www.instagram.com/p/9y_IC0rVOW/

His locks suit both his facial features and his personality and hence creating a perfect image for this soccer star.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/926290_590731160993570_537056245_n.jpg;soccer haircuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/OxUGcuwRXd/

His hair look is a slightly longer textured top and has a gradual taper on the sides and back of his head. For those who would want to copy him Jack's style works well for thick, wavy or curly hair but it is not ideal for straight hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10597409_753076138134963_1890396410_n-650x650.jpg;soccer haircuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/5JIdM6Cz0j/

The press is always attracted by interesting things that people would want to see and so there must be something special about his hair. Giroud's hair is pretty much similar to the cut that his teammate Wilshere wears. The only notable difference is that Giroud's cut has a softer disconnection between the sides and back, and more length is left on the top.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10004173_828845157191244_1574392739_n.jpg;soccer haircuts;https://www.instagram.com/p/8xS9NNNq91/

In this pompadour haircut, everything looks exaggerate at least by today's standards.

The hair on the sides should disappear two inches from the top hairs to draw more attention to your pompadour.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12292903_471557786364915_1066483655_n-650x650.jpg;pompadour haircut;https://www.instagram.com/p/4qOgV3EHIB/

What makes this cut special is the fact that it is very versatile and depending on your personal preferences you can have different lengths for the side and back layers. However, you have to make the hairs blend in or appear uniform by gradually increasing in size as they go towards the top section of the head. If you do not have a well-textured hair, you can use hair products, especially on the top hairs to add some texture.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12301317_1100038993347506_1041717317_n.jpg;pompadour haircut;https://www.instagram.com/p/9t9Exlwhwi/

The crown hairs are then swept to one side.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_3.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://roadtofreedom.tumblr.com/?og=1
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Crown Faux Hawk;Cristiano's faux takes inspiration from the traditional faux hawk but adds a twist to the style because the longer hairs do not go all the way to the back of the head. The faux hawk design is only made for the hair on the crown and then the rest of the head is trimmed short.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_4.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://www.polyvore.com/m/thing?.embedder=15412599&.svc=Pinterest&id=116477186

To wear this style all that is needed is to shave the sides short while living a longer top. The top should then be made messy, and some hold product applied.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_5.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;https://www.instagram.com/p/-yZADdBpYM/

http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;The Curly Affair;It is hard to imagine Ronaldo in a curly hair but he used to wear it at some point in his career, and he looked gorgeous. His curls were medium in length, and all that he had to do was to use some quality hair product on them then style them towards the back.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_10.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://cr7planet.tumblr.com/post/131945353687

http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Spiky Top with Razor Line;This is a classic formal or professional hairstyle that Ronaldo likes to wear when gracing important soccer events such as award ceremonies. In this look, the hair is almost uniform in length throughout the head, but the top is left slightly bigger for it to be able to be brushed back neatly. Two side parting lines are also created on both sides of the head.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_12.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut; 
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Pomp Inspired Brush Back;Judging from how often Ronaldo wears spikes he seems to love this style, and this is justifiably so since he looks great with†them. In this particular variation of the spiky top, he adds a deep razor line on one side with tapered sides.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_13.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://madridistaforever.com/post/131093763144

However, what makes it look like a pompadour is that the hair on the crown are left long and brushed buck while the sides are given a high fade. The longer top hair is also wavy and hence giving it almost pompadour like look when brushed back.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_14.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;https://www.talenthouse.com/item/1257603/c209d72a
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;The Classic Retro;The texture of the hair in this style, volume, dark color and the firmness are the things that make this style look good on Ronaldo.

http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Short Brush-Back Formal Haircuts;As amazing as this style may look there is pretty nothing much that Cristiano does to his hair. There is also no specification to the hair length required for this design. To wear the style just use wet gel on your hair and comb back the sides and back while leaving the top slightly messy.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_16.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://celevs.com/cristiano-ronaldo-fashion/

http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;The Wavy High Top;Most Cristiano Ronaldo haircuts involve leaving a longer top, but this style adds spice with some highlights. The sides are tapered, but it is the highlights at the top that seem to draw all the attention. His choice of brown for the highlights is also perfect for his skin tone.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_18.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://www.totalprosports.com/2013/03/01/fittest-bodies-in-sports/?utm_source=zergnet.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zergnet_67272#30
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Messy Spikes;This look†is stunning and apart from the cut the wax used for styling plays the biggest role in the style. The haircut is longer with a high top created by his naturally wavy hair. The sides and back are tapered and wax used to create an incredible wavy high top.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_19.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://photo-sharpen.com/
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Short, Clean and Simple;The traditional Cristiano   comes in many variations, and he is probably one of the celebrities that have inspired men who like spiky hair to try new styles on their spikes.

http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Classic Side Sweep and a Fairly Deep Side Line;In this style he does little to his hair as its natural appearance does all the magic. The only notable thing that he does to the hair is shaving the sides with the clippers on level one. Apart from that, soccer star†just uses some gel or pomade at the top section to make the natural spikes more detailed.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_21.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://madridistaforever.com/post/124847557734/photoset_iframe/madridistaforever/tumblr_nry1he0mvZ1tp29vi/500/false

However, he adds a twist to his style because unlike the conventional designs†he sweeps the longer crown hairs to the side rather than to the back. This is done neatly with a comb, and the hairs should be cut uniformly to ensure that the hair†holds. He finishes the look with a relatively deep side line.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_22.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;https://www.instagram.com/p/aLoMDjhpbe/
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Retro with Tapered Sides;This style adds a new dimension to the already unusual spikes with a brown highlight.

http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;The Vintage Brush Back;When men with spiky or flat ironed hair discovered that they could look good even with the hair short, this is one of the styles that they started experimenting with. However, Ronaldo spices up the look†by adding some tapered sides and an extra length at the top.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_24.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;https://www.instagram.com/p/chAp0rhpZd/
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Short Wavy with Diagonal Side Line;Vintage Brush Back is an epic style that you would have easily spotted with men in suits back in the 1950's, but it has made a comeback over the years and Cristiano seems to get it perfectly right. This haircut involves 2 to 3 inches of hair at the top and an inch on the sides and back. Some smoothening product is used on the hair†then it is brushed back but in a diagonal manner and given a simple side part.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_25.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;https://www.instagram.com/p/ufHvlPhpfN/
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Straight Middle Fringes;Men with wavy hairstyle should consider trying this players haircut†as it looks perfect for this type of hair. The wavy hair is left longer at the top then styled backward but what makes it more interesting is the diagonal line that starts an inch and a half from the center.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_26.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;https://www.instagram.com/p/64_X5lBpXn/
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Short and Fancy;If you do not have straight or spiky hair, then it might be necessary to flat iron it to wear this style. For this look, you can get side lines or shave the sides close to complete a simple but classy design. However, it should be done by a professional to ensure that it comes out perfect.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_27.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;https://www.instagram.com/p/7kW5Hjhpen/
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Smooth Waves;The person behind this hairdo†must be a master of his game because he does little to the hair, but it still comes out looking incredible. A longer length is maintained at the top of the head like most Ronaldo's hairstyles while the sides and back are carefully shaved to a uniform length with the clipper on level one to match the size of his sideburns.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_28.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;https://www.instagram.com/p/tyrywfD4UY/

http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Shaggy Top;Although Ronaldo's hair is naturally black, it appears to have been dyed in this style to make it even darker. However, the color is not the center of attraction in this†hairdo†because the medium length top bangs seem to steal the show. The bangs should be thick enough, so they can even be pushed back with the hands. There is practically nothing done on the sides and back except that they are shaved short.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_30.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3223313/Cristiano-Ronaldo-Wayne-Rooney-Neymar-Sergio-Aguero-10-valuable-sports-stars-Twitter.html

In this style, the sides and back are neatly pushed back after being gelled while the longer top is left unkempt. After applying some gel on the top hairs, you can use your hands to make the top shaggy or messy but to look as good as Cristiano your hair should be spiky.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_31.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://wallpaper-fantastic.blogspot.com/2014/02/cristiano-ronaldo-2014-wallpaper-hd.html
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;The Modern Faux;This look†brings together the two most important traits of this soccer star's hair. Although the crown is spiky, it is not the conventional straight spikes since they are made to appear more wavy than straight.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_32.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://www.lovelyhairstyles.net/cristiano-ronaldo-haircuts-2012.html
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Sideways Comb with a Side Part;You do not always have to go with the traditional styles to look good, and this cut proves this beyond any doubt. It draws inspiration from the faux hawk, but it is different in two ways. First the long hair is only maintained on the head crown, and secondly, the longer hair has more detailed spikes. Sides and back are shaved to the same length as the traditional faux hawks.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_33.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/541346817680345483/
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Short Side Waves;If you have beautiful hairs getting a fabulous style is very simple, and sometimes all you need is a comb. In this haircut, the top is trimmed to about three inches while the back and sides are closely shaved but not very close to exposing the skull. A side part is then created, and the crown hairs combed sideways to finish the look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_34.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/547961479641515123/
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;The Refined Look;Waves do not always have to be   or pushed forward to look good as there is still the option of sweeping them to one side of the head. However, to wear this Cristiano Ronaldo haircut you should not have any visible side parts, and the sides and back should be scissor trimmed short.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_35.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://madridistaforever.com/post/128360127899
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Messy Curls;What makes this haircut look refined is the size of the hair that is left at the top. It is his natural hair, and there is no sign of any use of a product. The long crown hairs take up the natural texture of his locks, and so they appear slightly spiky and also wavy. The rest of the head should then be shaved with the clipper on level two to maintain a decent length.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_36.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://www.gq.com.mx/articulos/cristiano-ronaldo/1827
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;The Wonder Spiky Bangs;The versatility of Ronaldo's hair is something that most of his fans envy since he can try almost any style that he can think of without having to do much with his natural hair. In this particular look, he maintains a curly top but leaves it messy while leaving the sides and back short.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_37.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/547961479640232530/
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Sleek Top with Detailed Angles; may be a little bit tricky to wear but with a good barber or stylist these should not be a problem and so Ronaldo must have had the services of a skilled pair of hands. Since the bangs will be slicked back, they should be left long enough, and you can give them some highlights to make things more interesting.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_38.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://www.footballyze.com/league/spain-la-liga_4/top-scorers
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;The Faux Hawk;The sleek top hair in this cut is magnificent enough but what will probably draw most people's attention are the precise angles on the forehead and the sides. These are razor cut angles and will require a very steady and experienced hand to get them right.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_39.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://www.buzzfeed.com/juliapugachevsky/which-fifa-player-should-you-hook-up-with
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Spiky Top with Double Razor Side Part;Although he mostly prefers to wear different variations of the faux hawk he has been spotted many times wearing the conventional one. His style is similar to the conventional one in many aspects because it maintains a longer hair in the middle part stretching all the way to the back while the sides are shaved short. However, this style seems to look particularly well on Ronaldo due to his thick and dark hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_40.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://photo-sharpen.com/

http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Curly and Wavy;The deep side part line that is made using the razor is what brings out the contrast in the two levels of hair in this haircut to make it a magnificent style. Sides and back are given a high fade while the longer and wavy top is gelled then styled back.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_42.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/458311699558725114/
http://machohairstyles.com/stunning-cristiano-ronaldo-haircut/;Classic Slick Back;It's rare to find a haircut that brings together curls and wavy hair, but the barber in this Cristiano Ronaldo haircut seems to have got the right mix between the two. A curly medium length hair is maintained at the top, and the curls left messy while the back and sides are trimmed just short enough to create a wavy appearance.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cristiano_ronaldo_haircut_43.jpg;cristiano ronaldo haircut;http://i734.photobucket.com/albums/ww343/bluegirl123_cfc/610x-3-2.jpg

It is intended to create a contrast to the bareness around the mouth and that effect turns out to be iconic.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bushy.jpg;Bushy;https://flic.kr/p/4pqFUm
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Scruffy Spot;For the guy who does not have a place for sideburns and thick lower   (or you are just not comfortable with them), here is the promise of superiority. With the hair around lower and upper orifices given rough short edges, the thick part of lower lip's tiny hollow is left exuding prominence. You do not miss to impress the ladies and that is something many men would play along with.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scruffy-Spot.jpg;Scruffy Spot;https://flic.kr/p/iYoD6
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Long Sideburns;And here comes what you have been waiting for from the 'smalls' of the lower lip. Most of the details go to the sides but they end way before they come close to the end of the jawline. All over sudden, the chin becomes clear but not that thin line dropping at the center on top of the jaw's handle. It left as the point of attraction and if in a hasty gaze you can't miss it.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Long-Sideburns.jpg;Long Sideburns;https://flic.kr/p/CcFBo
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Little Brown;If you ever wished for facial hair that will not entirely belittle your haircut, little brown is a top style that will deliver that in an instance. With the sides cleanly-shaven, you are only left with the small dip of brownness. It such a first-rate impression and be sure to be the newest rock star around town.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Little-Brown.jpg;Little Brown;https://www.instagram.com/p/9Em32cxmvE/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Wild Long;Did anyone say that things never get long and wild here? He lied since you can see it all for yourself. With all the facial hair gone, you are left with the racy strands that go long. There is a keen intent to keep everything sparse and you can see each strand once a mild breeze passes over your face. You can't resist having such a fuzzing beard so make it your choice today.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wild-Long.jpg;Wild Long;https://www.instagram.com/p/88tH2KtdoJ/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Oozing;Leave the obsession of guys wanting to have lots of   on their faces. You can have a simple piece that is only on your chin. It's a small impression that leaves your facial bones and cuteness exposed for all to see. You are right to make this choice and you will be the talk of town.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Oozing.jpg;Oozing;https://www.instagram.com/p/8wC75oPKaE/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Thick Chin;Creating contrast between your head and facial hairstyle is a show of how your mastery for trendiness has grown over the years. It breaks the monotony and dominance of singularity. Thick chin has the potential to create distinction that will separate you from the mob of men who just have a cut for the sake of it. A short stout patch is left under the low jaw and it rises to connect with the sideburns.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Thick-Chin.jpg;Thick Chin;https://www.instagram.com/p/8kNgfEiVo-/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Young He-Goat;There is never a better time to define your face hair style than when it is coming about. Young he-goat comes with the promise of taming your awn to look fresh. It is not long but adequate to cover the lower tip of the chin. You do not need to style it since leaving it natural gives its realness. Coupled up with your bowling hair on your head, you are stunningly handsome.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Young-He-Goat.jpg;Young He-Goat;https://www.instagram.com/p/8d7O5PtADw/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Rounded Spotty;With your sideburns ending before they reach your cheeks, you would need something that would make them pass for an intention. Follow this up by clearing all the facial hair (of course sparing the eye lashes and brows). Only what remains is streak that goes along the bend of the lower lip but not any further than the curvy section.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rounded-Spotty.jpg;Rounded Spotty;https://www.instagram.com/p/8HdB95JRne/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Curvy Edges;Having thick and long hair around you lips is tedious if you have to tend to it every other time. But wait! There is something creative you can do with it. What about trimming it to a flat and smooth bed style with sharp edges? This is what you are seeing here and it is startling. The under lip patch is groomed to an oval shape while the mustachio is inverted into thick bull horns. All the rest of mudpack hair is cleared out. This is the most brilliant style that you will ever come across in a while. There would be no blame if you make an instant decision to have it right away.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Curvy-Edges.jpg;Curvy Edges;https://www.instagram.com/p/7-0ZP1OZR-/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Classic Spot;Your long face pack of hair does not have to be a bother every other morning you want to attend a serious event. It is like a tiny insect stuck under your lower lip surrounded by bleakness. The sides are shaped to a rough texture or if you want it smooth there is no harm done to the looks. Cute in every sense is what you would call it.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Classic-Spot.jpg;Classic Spot;https://www.instagram.com/p/70IuozwdFM/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Dalliance Simple;Ladies want a romantic guy and this proves to be true and you know it. You do not have to spend an arm and leg to give them that look. A dalliance simple awn would be effective as you can see with this guy. Is there a lady who would resist the charm and agility she sees here? Not in her right mind and that could be you if you chose such a cut.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dalliance-Simple.jpg;Dalliance Simple;https://www.instagram.com/p/7OTVwCAOeh/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Green Patchy;Alright, you can tell that going wild with crazy colors can have such an impression on your looks. The beard is left to grow to a medium size and then straightened into finer strands. It is touched with a green dye and the results are just amazing. Bizarre you may say but you cannot resist the temptation to have this on you.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Green-Patchy.jpg;Green Patchy;https://flic.kr/p/4NsHR9
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;Look at Me;They will definitely look at you if you pull such a look, obviously not with your eyes but with trifling beard on you. Surrounded with starkness everywhere, you can tell that there was an emphasis to make that small spot to be noticed. Simple and perfection is all that you get for your fair bargain.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Look-at-Me.jpg;Look at Me;https://flic.kr/p/4Y8Tpv
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Swirling Effect;Not many people would notice that this is another cut from the hawk family. The short and flat landing top may deceive you but not after this. The sides are shaved to the skin as the longer top is styled into intricate backward swirls. This gives it an attractive appeal that you would feel superior in.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Swirling-Effect.jpg;Swirling Effect; 
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Long Dropping Sides;If you are the kind of a guy that wishes to preserve the side mane untouched, here is your pick. With the top in medium size, it is given a spiky end at the front hairline. The sides are left long and coiffured in a bundle that fall over the neck region. It is a professional looking design and you can knock doors on all occasions knowing that you are 'cool'.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Long-Dropping-Sides.jpg;Long Dropping Sides;https://www.instagram.com/p/_o1bpzkFxW/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Baked Crown;The lower sides up to the ears are shaved bare to act as the origin of the top crown. From the front, the hair is given a slight trim all the way down to the neckline. A brown-baked layer is added at the top and runs the same way to the neck. It is a cute guy look that will have heads turning everywhere you go.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baked-Crown.jpg;Baked Crown;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAJDN31Huda/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;High &†Smooth;Close skinned sides that are demarcated by a straight line where they end, are the humble foundation of the high top. The patch on the head crown is touched just a little and then finely combed towards the front. It is given a groovy turn at the forehead to form a 'cavy' impression. Both the front and back will leave you in awe and you cannot resist the temptation for one like this.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/High-Smooth.jpg;High & Smooth;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAI_p1JP0r1/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Shy Mohawk;The name is coined from the fact that it is not a full   since the spike middle top only goes as far as the drop of the back head and ends in a tapered impression. The sides are cleanly shaven to leave not-so-wide patch that gives rise to the 'hawky' crown.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shy-Mohawk.jpg;Shy Mohawk;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAI1HWtQNZZ/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Finger-Comb Long;Of all the styles you see here, this is one of the few that you will use your fingers to style it. The top is left edgy and runs low into the neck. The sides are treated to a combination of styles as upper area is tapered while the lower is cleaned to show the skin.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Finger-Comb-Long.jpg;Finger-Comb Long;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAGVxsjIrnr/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Fohawk Sweep;You must be amazed with the creativity of this cut because you never believed you could have a   for the bubble family haircuts. Yes, it is there with the front top and the nape separated to make a distinction of 2 sweeps. It is wild, popular and you can have that look anytime you feel like it.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Fohawk-Sweep.jpg;Fohawk Sweep;https://www.instagram.com/p/1175TULpyv/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Short &†Spiky;No show of skin at the sides but they are flattened to create the typical look for a hawk top. The top is left to medium length and then done to form front running spikes. Simplicity is here and you can go to your serious events without any jitters.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Short-Spiky-1.jpg;Short & Spiky;https://flic.kr/p/4MBrxP
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Cute Black;It brings out the handsomeness in your face by drawing away any hair strand to the forehead. The sides are finely combed backwards to form a lesser layer than the top. With only reserved combing, the top is tilted to the back but left vertical and with a spiky finish.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cute-Black.jpg;Cute Black;https://flic.kr/p/9NgmBS
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Furrowed Hawk;For those with sparse hair and want it in soft tone, you are at your best with this choice. The sides are designed to look like racing furrows and they move upwards. They give way to the craziness at the top which is long, racy and pointing to different directions. You are at your finest rocking look if this is what you choose for the forthcoming performance.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Furrowed-Hawk.jpg;Furrowed Hawk;https://flic.kr/p/4uNY95
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Precise &†Bridged;Every strand on the top mop is in its place. The sides are brushed into a smooth texture to create a stark contrast with what is coming on the top. The bridged scenario is at the drop of the back head where the nape region and the head top patches are separated. It is an easy going cut that will not require much attention to remain intact.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Precise-Bridged.jpg;Precise & Bridged;https://flic.kr/p/2VQsW
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Full Sides;As opposed to many cuts from the faded hawk, this one goes against the grain to leave the sides covered. They are only touched to look like they are shorter so as to keep the attention on the top. The top patch is shaped as†curls at the tips and make backwards groove. You can go for your professional engagements with such an appearance and be noted for your trendiness.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Full-Sides.jpg;Full Sides;https://flic.kr/p/9wunHZ
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Crocodile Spine;The entire hair is relaxed and oiled into a glossy appearance. The sides are cleared to leave the top as the dominating section. The middle bundles of the top are shaped into what appears as the scales of the spine of a crocodile. Girls will not miss to notice this and you will be their favorite.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crocodile-Spine.jpg;Crocodile Spine;https://flic.kr/p/7MqhsB
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Girth Look;Another type that spares the sides but this time they are combed towards the front to form a thick mop around the head. The top is lifted slightly to form an imitation of a Mohawk. You cannot deny that it is one of the best looks to redefine your sense of fashion.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Girth-Look.jpg;Girth Look;https://flic.kr/p/6YiUtq
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Tidy Top;The top section is formed from the ends of the sides and drawn to form a convergence at the middle of the head. The converged top ends in tips that form a tidy straight line of strands. It is simple and a definite catch for a young look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tidy-Top.jpg;Tidy Top;https://flic.kr/p/7Muez1
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Young Boys Style;You would be tempted to think that faux hawk fade cuts are meant for the big boys only. Definitely that is not true because even the small boys can have their own pick. The sides are drawn into a downward fall and where they begin marks the start of the top patch. It is combed upwards and brought together to form a thin confluence.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Young-Boys-Style2.jpg;Young Boys Style;https://flic.kr/p/afwsPr
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Buzzing Back;The sides and back are cleared to the skin. The top is left with what looks like a military influenced patch but this one has more additions. Groups of strands from the opposite corners of the top are dragged towards the center but they do not make any contact. They leave a thin line in between.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Buzzing-Back.jpg;Buzzing Back;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAKa_rtn54I/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Messy Top with Bangs;Just like their nature, bangs find their way into the faked Mohawk and the final results are impressive. The top is wide but left in a scattered formation. It looks rough but that is the intention. At the foreline, some short strands are dropped to point to the forehead but they only make a brief contact. You can tell its greatness if you are keen enough to see how each section complements each other.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Messy-Top-with-Bangs.jpg;Messy Top with Bangs;https://www.instagram.com/p/_FOpbekFrq/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Extreme Thick;There is a convention that the top of a hawk crown style is thin but the rules are redefined in the extreme thick haircut. With the sides trimmed to a shorter length, the top is left in a thickset. It is allowed to make natural waves which only add to the thickness that is a clear intention that the barber wanted to achieve.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Extreme-Thick.jpg;Extreme Thick;https://www.instagram.com/p/_U8ZrpSHTr/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Rat Tail;This style drew so much fuzz in the 80s and it has remained strong for all these years but not without some upgrades. The sides are shaved while the back is designed to what looks like a rat tail. It is a beauty to behold since the edges are so concise and superbly done. The top grows wider and strands from the opposites sides come together to form a flat crisscross.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rat-Tail.jpg;Rat Tail;https://www.instagram.com/p/-2V1iFDxmK/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Block Look;Cleared sides give way to a top that is shaped into a rectangle but with a higher front. The rise begins at the back neckline and grows gradually towards the frontline. At the forehead, it is grooved in an upward twist but makes an abrupt inward turn. For the guy who loves class, here is the promise to have it all.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Block-Look.jpg;Block Look;https://www.instagram.com/p/-TxzCkTEfu/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Cardinal Cap;Looking it from the front, you would notice a shape that looks like the popular cap worn by many ancient clerics. The top hair is grouped to have a pointed tip and wider base. The cap-like appearance is spoiled by the back that though shorter than the top makes a wide drop to the backline.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cardinal-Cap.jpg;Cardinal Cap;https://www.instagram.com/p/8wHOEaGdqU/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Buzzing Short;You can see the top patch buzzing in dominance. This effect has been created by what seems like rough tooth combs that did not finely style the hair. A clear cut line makes an outstanding separation with the sides. Around the top is a shaved mass that leaves the eye to focus on the short top-head buzz. If you do not have much time in your hands to keep retouching your hair every morning then here is how to have your way.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Buzzing-Short.jpg;Buzzing Short;https://www.instagram.com/p/uBzn2kQ1nY/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Professional Guy;There is a fashion code at you work place and you may seem rude to break it with your improper hairstyle. You do not have to mess with where your bread comes from when the professional guy hairstyle can serve to your formal look. With   and brushed to a smooth drop, the top is left in medium size and formed into a lofty look. It is a design for those who do not want a dull taste just because you have to impress your boss.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professional-Guy.jpg;Professional Guy;http://costinm.tumblr.com/post/22208117443
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Natural & Curly;Would it not be the most beautiful choice to leave your hair with its natural toughness and coils? You thought right. Here the sides are trimmed to get rid of any curls.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Slight Flip;He is looking refreshed and handsome simply because this is a top-end style that you should not doubt. Downward drawn sides and an upward top blotch create a contrast that will keep eyes admiring your looks. The top is combed straight up but given a mild flip that you may not notice if you are not keen.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Slight-Flip.jpg;Slight Flip;http://hotguypics.tumblr.com/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Subtle Kind;No one would miss to notice how this guy is gorgeous and all that has been exposed by the eye-catching hairstyle. Left to do its natural thing, the top head hair is driven towards the front but not all of it makes the smooth bow. Some strands defy the bow and remain spiked and you cannot deny the creativity in what finally sits on your head.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Subtle-Kind.jpg;Subtle Kind;https://www.instagram.com/p/-9V6FOPQRx/
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Military Imitation;Great haircuts used to be in the preserve of the boys in uniform. However, this is not the case anymore since you can have the style you want right now. This cut borrows a lot from the military look since the sides are pressed to a smooth bundle while the top is slanted to a hilly appearance. The only thing that deviates from the archetypal martial cut is that the middle tip is exaggerated to rise high and pointed.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Military-Imitation.jpg;Military Imitation;http://coolmenshair.com/2013/01/zac-efron-hairstyles.html
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Wavy Quiff with Bangs;The better aspect of this cut is the fact that you do not have to tend to it to look perfect. It is already in a great shape and even at a random photo shoot you would not look any less impressive. The sides are groomed into a thick layer and combed finely. The top is left with its waves and then drawn towards the front. At the forefront, a bundle of strands fall over as bangs.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wavy-Quiff-with-Bangs-1.jpg;Wavy Quiff with Bangs;http://annie-banks.tumblr.com/post/2490225095

http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Layered Top;Forming definite layers with your hair is a promise to look great. The layered top has the sides combed downwards leaving a uniform and smooth field. The top is portioned into two: the flat outer layer and the spiny middle top. It would be an ideal look for great performers and you are not missing a thing in your decent appeal.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Layered-Top.jpg;Layered Top;http://arkano18.tumblr.com/post/12282145619/david-wolfman-williams
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;Medium Shaggy;You do not have to get a fine tooth comb to give your bubbles that refined touch. You can have the top part shaggy and achieve the demeanour of a star. With dropping sides, the top is left to dominate you appearance. It is left rough and you will not believe the softness of the hair once you touch it. You cannot complain of taking much time to tend to your hair since you are ready-to-go straight from bed.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Medium-Shaggy.jpg;Medium Shaggy;http://mensfashion.about.com/od/goominghair/ss/ShortHair3_9.htm

You know they are not wrong since this is a top-end cut that many guys would not think twice to have. The front is given perfect spikes while the sides and back are smoothly faded. It is designed to give you a modern 'coolness' thus an easier decision to make.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rocker-Style.jpg;Rocker Style;http://goodvibes91.tumblr.com/post/22178711618/yum

You would too want to express your courage with long hawk with bangs. Superbly faded sides usher in the top-front racing patch. At the front, it is extended beyond the forehead to show a supremacy that is not common in many cuts. You will be the talk of town and influence many others to have the same.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Long-Banged.jpg;Long & Banged;http://www.tintanapele.com/2012/10/mod-boys-60-fotos-de-caras-tatuados.html

Hair is let to do its down growing to long strands. It may be left smooth or curled to whichever of the two you find better. It is a style to go for any occasion you may have. It can go as far as the shoulders and only a few bangs fall onto the front face but the sexiness is never faded whatsoever.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sexy-Maintained.jpg;Sexy Maintained;https://flic.kr/p/8UvdP4
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-bowl-cut-designs/;Uneven Locks;They are not what you would call locks but they create what would pass as a modernity of that ancient style. Sides are trimmed and bundled into thick glued bundles to form the foundation on which the top 'locks' would drop on. Top with its wavy interlocked bundles is drawn downwards but only to go as far the middle of the sides. A front is given a shallow cave appearance with 3 bangs forming tri-bangs impression. A†forehead is left untouched by any single strand and it is a stunning cut that would send the girls berserk.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Uneven-Locks-1.jpg;Uneven Locks;http://www.jedroot.com/photographers/anthony-maule/men-s-fashion/v-man-1/54d15501-10e8-4784-aae0-780c0a771fd0
http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-bowl-cut-designs/;Bleached Bowl;A bleached bowl would make a bold statement if the hair was bleached to spotless white. After the bleach, the low sides are shaved while the top is trimmed to medium size and dragged to fall around what is an unintended undercut. Tips of the bowl are trimmed to make it end before it reaches the eyebrows to the front and the ears at the sides. A†bold guy look is seen in every inch of the face and it all passes the test of greatness.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bleached-Bowl.jpg;Bleached Bowl;http://www.flickr.com/photos/separation_anxiety/6986907566/in/photostream
