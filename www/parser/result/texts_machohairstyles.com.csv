And the shortest haircut besides the clean shave is definitely the buzz cut. If you like short and smooth hairstyles that take little to no time to style, go for this one. It perfectly fits the square or oval face shape but will look nice with round faces as well. In case you are into more structured styles, leave the hair a little bit longer on top.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/√ê¬±√ê¬∞√ê¬∑-√ê¬∫√ê¬∞√ë¬Ç-650x553.jpg;
http://machohairstyles.com/best-10-hairstyles-for-men/;Crew cut;https://www.instagram.com/p/BO8hrUrA_VA/;The crew cut is of those hairstyles that look fashionable but still stay on the safe side so you don't look like you've spend a fortune on your look. This haircut looks perfect with any style whether you are wearing classic suits or sports clothes. When a barber creates the crew cut, the hair is kept longer in front and tapered according to the shape of the man's face and the head while the back and the sides are left short.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/√ê¬∫√ë¬Ä√ë¬é-√ê¬∫√ê¬∞√ë¬Ç-650x650.jpg;

This one does require some time and styling products to style but you can limit yourself to a styling gel or foam and a small hairdryer.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/√ê¬ø√ê¬æ√ê¬º√ê¬ø√ê¬∞√ê¬¥√ë¬É√ë¬Ä-650x650.jpg;

http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Contents:; ;But what exactly is the take of women on this previous domain of the older generation? Well, women are sometimes quite difficult to understand.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1-650x650.jpg;1
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array; ;They have that mysterious personality that makes them see things contrary to our expectations (well, I'm talking from a man's perspective). Therefore, the question as to whether or not women like beards is something that is up for debate.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12751615_1513451432295852_815798880_n-650x650.jpg;19
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array; ;Scientific studies have been conducted to paint a clear picture regarding the subject. One was conducted in the 1970s while the other was conducted four years ago. Despite the huge time difference that the studies were conducted, both of them came to a similar conclusion:;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/12917807_250736975274046_1915710891_n-650x652.jpg;2
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array;https://www.instagram.com/p/BCXuiKUBpXI/;Women find more attraction to men with stubble or light beards. Men with full-grown beards were found least attractive owing to their aggressive yet mature look.

http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array;https://www.instagram.com/p/BD85AJJhpeK/;Two different statistics were also conducted to seek women's opinions on male facial hair. One was in the form of a simple poll that asked a large sample of women whether they are attracted to men with facial hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/5-650x650.jpg;5
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array; ;The report showed that the majority of women find men with beards unattractive. The second study drew a comparison between clean shaven and bearded men. The women were provided with photos lineups of men and asked to select the most attractive.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/6-650x812.jpg;6
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array; ;A majority chose photos of bearded men over the clean-shaven ones. This study actually contradicted the findings from the simple poll.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/7-650x650.jpg;7

From the above studies, it is clear that women hold different views regarding beards. Some prefer men with beards while others see such men as a total waste of their time.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/8-650x812.jpg;8
http://machohairstyles.com/women-like-beards/;Array; ;So it's all about preferences. However, there must be an explanation from each side of the divide.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-tape-up-haircut/;# 2 The Wavy Temple Fade; ;This taper fade is one of the most preferred among Caucasian males as it embraces both curly hair and edgy trims.

http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;; ;There has always been a debate on what determines hair thickness. Every person wishes to have thick strands especially on the head, and this is what brings about interest in the factors that determine hair thickness.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/11.jpg;11
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;; ;However, it is an unquestionable fact that your genetics will affect the thickness of your hair. The same way that your genes will determine the texture, color and length of your strands is just the same way they will influence their thickness.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/42638e56dd98167a65356786564a73ef.jpg;inf2
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;; ;A good example of this is the fact that Asian hairs are about 30% thicker than those for Africans and slightly more than 50% more voluminous than the Europeans. Genetics influence the volume of hair follicles and the thicker your follicles are, the thicker your hair will be.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2-650x650.jpg;2
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;;https://www.instagram.com/p/BGpTYg-lpxv/;Other factors such as age also have an effect on how thick your strands will be. As you grow old, your strands will not be as healthy as they were in your younger years and so they will appear thinner. No matter how many times you shave your strands you can never get back the volume that you lose due to age, and this should be enough proof that shaving does not affect hair thickness.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ff14433153cfc2f034302628b15034ff.jpg;inf1
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;; ;Other factors that may alter the volume of your locks include disease and how you treat them. Most types of cancer and other skin conditions will cause hair loss and in most cases when or if the strands grow back, they will appear thinner than before.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/3-650x650.jpg;3
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;; ;Subjecting your hairs to harsh chemicals or too much heat may also affect their thickness and in most cases the strands become fragile with time.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/6-650x812.jpg;6
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;Array; ;Contrary to what most people think the medical or scientific literature has a lot of information regarding this topic. The debate on whether shaving and thickness have any relationship has been there for hundreds of years. And so it was only a matter of time before scientists took the liberty to prove or refute this claim.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4c9244fae8947e833f46a0a610c53e79.jpg;inf3
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;Array; ;The first in-depth research into the subject was in 1928 where four men participated in a hair regrowth experiment. In conducting these studies the men cut the strands on their faces in one downward stroke using the same shaving soap, a similar brand of razor, and water at the same and constant temperature.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/5-650x401.jpg;5
http://machohairstyles.com/does-shaving-make-hair-thicker/;Array; ;The authors of the study collected the strands and compared them with the ones that grew back, and the simple conclusion was that there was no relationship between shaving and a person‚Äôs hair texture, color or its volume.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4-650x416.jpg;4

And you can taper the rest of the hairs to ensure all the attention remains on the exquisite design on top or also pull then into the pony if you do not wish to cut your locks.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Elaborate-Braid-and-Pony-650x704.jpg;Elaborate Braid and Pony

http://machohairstyles.com/best-man-bun-hairs/;# 40 Dreads with a Shaggy Dude Bun;https://www.instagram.com/p/2_jNWRlry1/;This hairstyle looks very effortless, and it comes from twisting and wrapping some grown out dreadlocks at the center of the head. The style does not follow a precise pattern, and so you should not make any attempt to make it neat because the rugged look is what makes it look lovely. However, men with extended foreheads and would want to wear this style can leave a few bangs hanging over the forehead. And this is because this will help to conceal this physical feature. And if you pair this design with some medium size facial hairs you will have a very stylish appearance.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dreads-with-a-Shaggy-Dude-Bun.jpg;Dreads with a Shaggy Dude Bun

http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;# 3 Ask a Friend to Help; ;Before you start making your hair, it is crucial to decide the size that you want because it might not be possible to get your natural hair back once you make the locks. The thickness of dreads can be anything between half an inch and one inch, but a few people often have theirs thicker or thinner than this. If you go with thick dreads, then you will have fewer locks on your head, and so they will also be easier to make. Thicker ones also become compact faster than thin ones, but their greatest disadvantages are that there are harder to brush back when you change your mind, and they are also complicated to maneuver when you want to wear different styles. However, it is important to know that the thickness of the locks will also depend on your hair type. For example, men with thinning hair will only look good in thick ones since their hair makes it hard for them to get thin locks even if they want.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Decide-on-the-Size-of-the-Locks.jpg;Decide on the Size of the Locks
http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;# 4 Prepare Your Hair;https://www.instagram.com/p/8lSs5mBA0Z/;If you decide to dread yourself, then you should be prepared for a tedious task as it is quite a job. In fact, if you do it alone it would take you the entire day if not longer depending on the volume and length of your hair. The difference between creating the dreadlocks yourself and having a professional do it is the fact that the stylist has more experience than you. Some even have special equipment that will help them get the job done fast. And so if you want to have some neat and uniform dreads soon you should ask a friend or two to come help. You should not worry about the outcome because the locks are very easy to make, and anyone can give perfect ones once they figure out how to do them. Apart from getting a couple of friends to help it is also important to find a place that you will be comfortable to seat for a couple of hours so as to avoid any back pains later on.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ask-a-Friend-to-Help.jpg;Ask a Friend to Help
http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;# 5 Brush to Remove Tangles and Knots;https://www.instagram.com/p/BArwKQVOK40/;You should only dread your hair when it is clean and dry contrary to what some people think. It does not have to be sparkling clean, but you should have at least washed it a couple of days before. There is a common belief that dreads should be done on dirty hair as the dirt helps them become compact faster, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Working with dirty and greasy hair not only makes your task more difficult but can also prevent your dreadlocks from forming well, and it will also take longer. To prepare it well you should shampoo it two or more hours before but avoid the conditioner as it will not help you in any way. After washing, you should towel dry or let it air dry. Note that at the preparation stage is also where you should also get rid of any other hairdos that you may have for example braids.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ask-a-Friend-to-Help-1.jpg;Ask a Friend to Help

Even when you go to a professional to have your dreadlocks, the stylist will always brush it before working on it. Brushing will make it easy to separate and also to section your strands, and so you should not skip this step. Although it is advisable not to use hot tools on your hair, sometimes it might be necessary to blow dry the hair to make it straighter and hence even easier to work with. Getting rid of the tangles also ensures that you get neat dreads.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Prepare-Your-Hair.jpg;Prepare Your Hair
http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;# 7 Backcomb and Twist the Section;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAKkEegrra3/;Sectioning the hair is one of the trickiest steps in wearing dreadlocks because you have to get the sections right in size and shape as this will determine how the locks will look. For most people one or two inches square sections will create amazing dreadlocks, and so you should also go with these sizes to get the best results. When sectioning the hair, you should start with the underside of your hair and work your way to the front. There are two ways that you can go about this step. The first one is to secure each section with a rubber band after separating it from the rest of the hair and do this until you finish the entire head. You can also create dreads with each section after sectioning so that by the time you finish dividing all the hairs you will also be through with making the dreadlocks.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Prepare-Your-Hair-1.jpg;Prepare Your Hair

http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;# 9 Palm Rolling; ;If you want to know how to do dreads then you have to understand what backcombing and twisting is and how to do them. After sectioning the hair into one or two inches boxes, the next step and probably the most important one is creating the dreads. Backcombing is just one of the many ways of creating dreads, but it is the most widely used because the hairs look like dreadlocks on the same day you make them, and they also mature faster than when using other techniques. To backcomb your sectioned hair, you should use a dread comb to comb the sectioned hair backward starting, at least, an inch or closer to the scalp. You should backcomb a few strands at a time and eventually the hair will begin to build up at the roots. Although it is not necessary to twist the hair, it will be helpful if you can roll the strands that you are holding as you continue to backcomb. Continue backcombing while making sure that the hair is as tight as possible and once you reach the end secure the new lock with a rubber band and put another at the root to help it also remain in place at the base.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Brush-to-Remove-Tangles-and-Knots-1.jpg;Brush to Remove Tangles and Knots

http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;# 11 Style the New Locks; ;You should repeat the backcombing and twisting process above for all the sections and tie each new dread with two rubber bands before you can wax the hair. Before you get to the waxing, you should ensure that all the sections are tightly in place. Waxing is simpler than backcombing but equally important as it helps in taming rogue strands and aids in the faster maturity of the dreadlocks created. To wax the hair, take a small amount and work it between your fingers to soften it or remove any clumps. You should then apply it to the backcombed sections starting from the roots and working your way to the tips. It is important to use a little at a time to avoid creating a waxy mess on your locks as you can always add some more in case the wax is not enough. Choosing the right wax type is important to get a good hairdo. You should go for good brands and avoid anything with petroleum.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dread-Comb.jpg;Dread Comb

Since the hair already looks good after the waxing, most people will skip this step especially given the fact that they are exhausted from all the work done so far, but this is not such a wise idea. It does not take a lot of time to palm roll, and so if you want a perfect look, you should take the time to do it or have your friends do it for you. Starting at the roots, you should briskly roll your newly created dreadlocks between your hands to the end. Repeat this for all the locks to give them a beautiful finish.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Backcomb-and-Twist-the-Section-1.jpg;Backcomb and Twist the Section

http://machohairstyles.com/how-to-do-dreads/;# 14 Condition Your Dreadlocks; ;If it is your first time to wear dreadlocks and you have never even done them for a friend, then you will probably not get things right the first time. It is very understandable especially with the first few sections as your hands get used to this or before you master the pattern. And so once you finish palm rolling the hair you should go through all the sections to ensure that everything looks beautiful. The chances are that you will find a couple of portions that are loose even after waxing and although you might be tempted to palm roll as this is easier you should redo it again from the backcombing stage. Provided you were keen enough when working on the hair very few of them will be loose if at all any. And so to ensure that you get the best dreads, backcomb the loose ones then wax them again but make sure they do not become too waxy. Redoing some section will help you create some outstanding dreadlocks.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Palm-Rolling.jpg;Palm Rolling

Although there are many available out there the best ones and also, the most useful ones are the ones that you make at home. It might look easier to buy one and just apply to your hair but by doing so, you will be losing out on many nutrients that are essential for hair growth. The packaged hair masks might smell and look better, but they usually have some preservatives, fragrance and also some colorants. Instead of going for these processed products you can make a simple but very effective mask at home with aloe and egg white. And apart from the many benefits that it will offer you, it is also pretty easy to make, and it only takes a couple of minutes. The aloe should be fresh, but if you cannot find it, then a bottled one that is 100% pure will also work.

Taking good care of the roots and the scalp is as important as anything else that you do to your locks to aid in growth if not more important. If the hair is healthy as it starts to grow then, it will get longer fast, and you will have very few split ends. One of the best ways to take care of the scalp is through a hot oil massage however you still have to choose the right oils if you want to stimulate growth. The best for this are olive, argon or coconut oil. You should heat up the oil and gently rub it into your scalp for about ten minutes and leave it to soak the hair for about half an hour. After this, you should finish by rinsing off with some warm water.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/A-Hot-Oil-Massage-Is-Also-Beneficial.jpg;A Hot Oil Massage Is Also Beneficial

To avoid the problems that come with the use of shampoo you should limit its use to two or three times a week and also, use conditioner every time you use it. Conditioner helps to replace the proteins and lipids in the hair shaft and seal the cuticles against any further damage and hence ensuring that your hair grows longer and healthier.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Limit-the-Use-of-Shampoo.jpg;Limit the Use of Shampoo

Hair dyes are all made out of chemicals whether they are permanent or†semi-permanent. It is crucial to understand that your locks†and chemicals do not mix well and so when dying the hair you are usually making a compromise between long healthy hair and a beautiful appearance. The chemical damage caused by bleaching and coloring is immense, and there is usually no other way to bring back your hair to its original state except for cutting it. And so if you keep on coloring your locks you will always be forced to cut them down after some time, and this will limit the growth.

However, as much as you do not like it you should ensure that you do it right for your strands can grow. First you should not brush wet hair as this will lead to breakages. Wet hair is fragile and so when you brush it you risk losing many strands. You should take a few minutes to towel dry your hair gently before brushing. Also, choose the right comb or brush for your hair by avoiding anything that has very hard bristles even if it can get the job done faster. When it comes to untangling the hair you have to be very patient, or you will ruin the hair. Before you even start brushing, you should try to untangle the locks with your fingers as this reduces the risk of breakages.

Rosemary is particularly very useful, and it has been widely used on hair for many years as it stimulates the hair follicles and adds some luster to your locks. And just like most other herbs it will encourage faster growth because it improves circulation. To use rosemary or any other herb you should prepare an infusion by steeping the herb in hot water for about 20 minutes. You should then use the rosemary infusion as a final rinse after shampooing and conditioning the hair, or you can also mix it in with the shampoo.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Choose-Your-Products-Wisely.jpg;Choose Your Products Wisely

Using hot tools on your hair whether it is short or long is abusing the hair and it will not only cause breakages but will prevent fast growth. What these tools do - they make the hair weak and damage the scalp and so your hair will just not grow and if it does it will not be uniform. If you must use some heat on your strands, you should not overdo it, and it is also recommended that you do it occasionally.

However, good mane†health is not all about staying stress-free because what you eat will also affect growth. Eating a balanced diet will help your locks grow long, but the best foods for this are those with B vitamin biotins such as salmon and avocado. Other healthy foods for the hair are sources of folate such as berries and whole grain, B12 foods like fish and dairy products and B6 such as kale and broccoli. Apart from eating a balanced diet, it is also important to avoid processed foods so as to maintain a healthy body and hence also faster hair growth.

Clean hair is also known to grow faster than a dirty one. However, if you do not wash it the right way you will lose all these benefits and probably also do more harm than good to your strands. As mentioned earlier on you have to choose the right shampoos and conditioner for your hair, but proper hair washing does not just stop at these two as there is way much more involved. For example, the water temperature and purity will affect the hair health directly and so you should be careful with them. Most men wash hair with hot water because they think that it will get rid of all the gel build up and any germs, and it also feels good on the scalp, but this is not beneficial to your strands. Washing hair regularly with hot water will lead to breakage and hence preventing your strands from growing long. The effect of hot water is very evident, and you can easily prove it by changing to cold water for a couple of weeks and see the difference. You should also not use too much shampoo or conditioner and neither should you wash the locks every day. In fact, it is recommended that you only wash your strands about three times a week. It may not look very hygienic, but it will help you get long locks within a shorter time. If you have issues with the greasiness that is a result of less washing, you should wear a hat for a couple of days so that the scalp can adjust and stop producing too much oil.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Herbs-Infusion.jpg;Herbs Infusion

Even if you do not like drinking too much water, or you just forget about it, you have to try harder and take as much water as possible to get a longer hair. The mane†is one of the things that show that your body does not have enough water because the strands will be dull and dry. Dull and dry strands are prone to breakage, and this is one of the main things that can prevent you from getting long locks. It goes to show that a few liters of water a day are just as important as using the right product and doing regular trims if you want long locks. If you have trouble drinking plain water, you can drink flavored water or green tea as they will serve the same purpose. However, you should avoid alcohol, caffeine and soda.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Herbs-Infusion-1.jpg;Herbs Infusion

The biggest problem when it comes to styling spiky hairs with other gels is flaking and this totally ruins their look. Axe took the time to ensure that their asset†can be able to hold the spikes firmly in place for an entire day. And this was achieved through the choice of ingredients and consistency. When applying, it might feel like any other ordinary gel but after it dries in a couple of minutes that is when you get to see the magic that it does on your spikes. Unlike other products, it does not form a very hard layer and neither are the hairs too soft. The hold created is just enough to ensure that the style remains in place throughout the day. And to make things even better, it has a unique shine and a sweet scent that will make everyone want to smell your hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Suavecito-Pomade-Firm-Hold.jpg;Suavecito Pomade Firm Hold

However, nothing is more annoying than when it flakes just a couple of minutes after leaving the house. And this may happen despite how good you styled your mane†or what design you used as it is caused by the wrong choice of product. What you use on your strands will not only determine how beautiful the hairdo will look but also how long it will hold. And so if you want something that you can rely on to maintain your style throughout the day then the Premium Hair Styling Gel is what you need. It has been designed with you in mind knowing what you have to go through to get a perfect look, and so it will ensure that you get to keep it for the entire day.

Although some work as they claim most others will always disappoint you as they do not meet your expectations. The manufacturer of this gel goes to a great extend to ensure that users are happy with the results that they get. Although there are others on the market that can also give a good hold what makes this one particularly special is its smooth non-greasy texture. Apart from the incredible style of the crown (or the head if you keep uniform length throughout) there is nothing else that will betray what you have applied it. The characteristic greasy appearance associated with other products is nonexistent here, and it is replaced by an incredible shine which†will make your strands livelier. When applying you only need to scoop a little with your fingertip and rub between the fingers to liquefy. On application, it folds into your locks nicely. A little goes a long way, and so you do not have to apply too much which can cause the ugly greasy appearance. However, you can apply a little more if you want a super hold.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Style-Sexy-Hair-Hard-Up-Gel.jpg;Style Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel

However, if you value self-grooming like most men do then chances are, you have used this product at some point. In spite of the debate which†has always been there about it, the only thing people seem to agree about is that it is very efficient in styling and holding the hair. Suavecito is a water soluble product that has all the fantastic qualities of the old fashion pomade and has been given a few extra ingredients and consistency for a firmer hold. The water-solubility also makes it easy to wash out as you only require water and a mild shampoo. Leaving some pomade on your hair will ruin it, and so any product that you use should be completely washable before you can make a fresh application. With this pomade, you can maintain a great hairstyle for a product which†has been made the old fashion way with some quality organic and natural ingredients;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/TIGI-Bed-Head-B.jpg;TIGI Bed Head B

Natural ingredients not only make the product work much better, but they also make the hair and scalp healthier. These ingredients are also beneficial in the prevention of dry scalp and dandruff and hence making a man look cleaner and more elegant. The other thing that makes this product special is that it can be used on both dry and wet hair and still give perfect results. However if you want a shinier result, it is recommended you use it on wet hair. It is important to note that with this pomade the hold will still be perfect regardless of whether you apply it to dry or wet hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KS-Premium-Forming-Cream-for-Men.jpg;K+S Premium Forming Cream for Men

And so these men can wear any style that they wish even using the worst quality products and still look great. However, as age catches up, they will no longer have this privilege as the strands become thinner and more flyaway. And when this happens you need something reliable that can keep your design in place the whole day and the Clubman Styling Gel is the thing for you. This product has been designed for application on any hair, and so you can get an elegant hairdo using it whether you have thick locks or fragile strands. It works better than most that are currently on the market and just by applying a small dab you can be assured that your bangs will remain in place for the entire day or even longer if you wish. If you do not like very stiff hair, you only need to run a brush or comb through once the hair dries for a smoother finish. Even when you run a comb through it still holds the hair in place, but the difference will be that it does not glue together.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/L√¢¬Ä¬ôOreal-Paris-Studio-Line-Melting-Gel.jpg;L√¢¬Ä¬ôOreal Paris Studio Line Melting Gel

However, what makes it unique is that one bottle can last even up to one year for some men because you only need a small dab for a perfect finish. Even if you like to style the hair more than once a day the 16oz bottle will take you for several months. In the world of today, manufacturers do not design retail products that last for long because they want you to come back and buy more, so this makes Clubman not only special but also unique. The beautiful and non-overpowering fragrance will also make you smell like a man, and this is very different from other hair stylers. Although others have very nice smells most of the time, they are overpowering and can be disturbing if you prefer to use a generous amount. Clubman is different because the fragrance is mild which makes it manlier and also one of the best hair gel for men.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Suave-Professionals-Men-Styling-Paste.jpg;Suave Professionals Men Styling Paste

The cut in this style leaves, at least, two inches of hair in the crown. This makes it possible for the hair to be brushed back. Sides are blade shaved while the back has a much softer fade. Styling gel is applied to wet the hair, and then it is brushed back with a comb then it is air dried to finish the look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/brad_pitt_hairstyles_101-650x650.jpg;brad pitt hairstyles

http://machohairstyles.com/hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;# 9 Spiky Perfection;https://www.instagram.com/p/--GDGghM8v/;All types of locks†can be textured and made spiky, but naturally thick hair has an edge over the rest because it holds the spikes much better than other hair types even without using any products. In this cut, the spiky mane†at the top is combined with well shaped facial hairs that go very well with the hairstyle.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_9.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair

http://machohairstyles.com/hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;# 11 Perfectly Messy Cut;https://www.instagram.com/p/-KzHteIzHM/;There are many ways to get a messy look and just like this cut most of them involve clean shaved sides and back to ensure that all the attention remains at the top locks. Although the cut in this hairstyle is similar to other messy haircuts†the styling is perhaps what makes it distinct and unique. What is more interesting is that only pomade wax is used to achieve this gorgeous look, and no blow drying is required. A clean shaved face also adds some value to this hairstyle.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_11.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair
http://machohairstyles.com/hairstyles-for-thick-hair/;# 12 The Eclipse Cut;https://www.instagram.com/p/9XQqT3IzOE/;This hairstyle is for confident men who are willing to go the extra mile and experiment with their mane. However, this cut is still not as extreme as others, and it involves thick hair at the top that is trimmed to about three inches, styled and slightly swept to the side. The sides are then faded, but what gives it uniqueness is the distinct line introduced on one side just a few inches before the ear. It looks like a parting line but it is created in an area with little hair and so the line itself is the center of attraction and not what it does to the hair.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_12.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair

This style needs almost no cut at all except for slight trimming to level up the hair. You can then style the locks†by side parting and pushing a portion of them†to one side.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_17.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair

Some skillful tapering is done on the hair to give it the distinct layers and to make them more visible. Undercuts are also done on the sides and the back of the head to finish the look. However, to wear the winter tapers the most important part is tapering and so you should choose a barber that is skilled at this. You can also add some color to the top layers and style them frontwards to finish the look.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hairstyles_for_thick_hair_18.jpg;hairstyles for thick hair

In this cut, the short dreads are left on the top section of the head with the sides and back being shaved closely. The cut requires medium to long hair, and you should have a professional work on your boy's hair to give them perfect short dreads.

They are dreadlocks that are done in a different way from the famous or conventional locks. In this style, ends of the locks are fake hair and not necessarily the hair of the wearer. The ends are also not locked in like the rest of the hair, and so they form what looks like a fallen tree on the head.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Himba-Dreadlocks.jpg;Himba Dreadlocks

The mane†starts with a simple and neat design†on the crown, but things get crazy with the introduction of the long blue locks that are styled to face upwards.

This style seems to draw inspiration from these warriors, but the wearer takes things further by adding a ring to one of his two locks.

Just by looking at it you can tell that it is very complicated and very hard to create. The web that forms the base is probably the easier thing in the cut†because the spider is quite detailed with its legs being formed through braiding.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Spider-on-the-web.jpg;Spider on the web

A side part is optional, but it is a good idea to have it as it can enhance your look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12237607_1652096018395295_1567377993_n-650x650.jpg;pompadour haircut

The hairs at the top do not go very high above the head as the pompadour is made medium in height and the sides are skin faded to complete a simple look. This cut can be worn as a formal or casual look since it's simple but still stylish.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12120253_1637288649859853_896984102_n-650x650.jpg;pompadour haircut

Since the pompadour is big and wider, it will require that you combine it with wider and thicker sideburns. If your sideburns are not thick enough then you would look better in a pompadour by shaving them completely.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10575969_414462798756299_1840026682_n-650x650.jpg;pompadour haircut

The classic Elvis look is quite common, and it involves pretty longer top hair and tapered sides, but you can also have it with short clipped back and sides. Pomade is the best hair product that you should use to style this pompadour.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12063130_1511239772535440_1422352799_n.jpg;pompadour haircut

In this cut, the top hair is left long then disconnected from the base hair with a side parting. A bald fade is then used to disconnect the lower section of the head from the face so as to draw attention to the beard on the face. The beard should be well kept to go with the nicely done pomp.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12070715_899467790147462_1985199705_n-650x650.jpg;pompadour haircut

The top hair is long and voluminous, and so when it is styled into a pompadour, it creates a massive but stylish appearance. The style is finished with a neat high fade. High fading the sides and back is important as it helps draw attention to the massive pompadour on top.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/11378427_943420125725396_500785803_n.jpg;pompadour haircut

In this pompadour haircut, everything looks exaggerate at least by today's standards. The pompadour is big in width and height, and it looks like a foreign object on top of the head, but it still makes a good haircut especially for people with bigger foreheads as it draws attention away from it.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/11324468_2100011216806251_2100428349_n.jpg;pompadour haircut

Start with a side part then sweep the longer front hairs to one side. Next you should create a baseline with the hair on the crown of the head then slightly fade an inch or so of the hair after the baseline. After the fade, you can create a small bald part that joins your face. Also, you should reduce the size of your beard to a neat size that will blend in well with your pomp.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12276773_1513698012291196_502679700_n-650x650.jpg;pompadour haircut

In this cut, the back is reduced to a size smaller than the top section and then parted into two sections vertically. Each side is then swept in the opposite direction from the other to create the jellyroll.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/11373518_662650950503267_418313423_n-650x650.jpg;pompadour haircut

Since the pomp is short, it will be more highlighted if you pair it with a high fade. The hair on the sides should disappear two inches from the top hairs to draw more attention to your pompadour.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12292903_471557786364915_1066483655_n-650x650.jpg;pompadour haircut

What makes this cut special is the fact that it is very versatile and depending on your personal preferences you can have different lengths for the side and back layers. However, you have to make the hairs blend in or appear uniform by gradually increasing in size as they go towards the top section of the head. If you do not have a well-textured hair, you can use hair products, especially on the top hairs to add some texture.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12301317_1100038993347506_1041717317_n.jpg;pompadour haircut

However, this one adds a twist to the hairstyle with the introduction of a side part that makes it possible to slick some of the hairs on the side.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Classic-Rockabilly-Look.jpg;Classic Rockabilly Look
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 2 Soft Spot; ;Simple, flexible and all-going are the precise adjectives which should describe this beard. Get done with the sideburns and the under chin hair in readiness for mercurial softness. The jazz dot is left ruling your facial look and it does not disappoint any bit. It is a real catch if you complement it with an excellent haircut. The guys in your social circle would want such a piece so be happy that you lead the pack.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Soft-Spot.jpg;Soft Spot
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 3 Stubble;https://flic.kr/p/amFuDk;You never want a beard that will take your time when you want to be on your way to an important meeting. The stubble dot will work magic on your face. It is tiny but its presence cannot be missed. It is a thing that celebs would want to have and this tells you why you should have it now. Once more, you cannot dismiss the simplicity that comes with it and that is a plus for.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Stubble-1.jpg;Stubble
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 4 It is There;https://flic.kr/p/rVGCh1;Of course it is there but you have to look deeper to ascertain that. Surrounded by white shortness, a†beard is left rough. The only strands with any considerable length are small patch below the center of the lower lip. For the best results ensure that there is no other hair on or around the beard. If it is super then it only has to be visible and that is the unpredictability of what you have here.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/It-is-There.jpg;It is There
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 5 Tiny Island;https://flic.kr/p/HDcpV;The island look is a binding style that gets all the attention to your lower face. A thin line of hair drops from the center lower lip and makes way to the groove of the chin. It is surrounded by bareness and thus looking like a lonely island in a wide sea. It is a simplified style that will not be missing the notice of those who know how great   like. You do not have to tend on it, it is already befitting.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tiny-Island.jpg;Tiny Island
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 6 Thin†&†Long;https://flic.kr/p/6SNDg5;It is small but that is never a reason why it will not grow long. For those who want long styles but without the burden of much hair, here is the perfect patch. It does not have to be about thickness for your chin to get a fair look when all you need is a genius idea such as this one.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Thin-Long.jpg;Thin & Long
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 7 Grey Fineness;https://flic.kr/p/h3kfL1;There is nothing wrong if your hair is grey. In fact, you can make those who do not have it envy your styles. The low lip rift shows off a grey thicket which is the only long section around the chine. The top lip has a matching grey band that extends from one corner to the other.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Grey-Fineness.jpg;Grey Fineness
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 8 Wide &†Noticeable;https://www.instagram.com/p/_4nFI6xlG6/;If you want something thick and visible, here is the bet that will never go wrong. It covers the chin and makes a connection between two sides of the interconnections between the lips. When you bring together the upper and lower lips, it looks like a continuous noticeable mop that only breaks when the lips part.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wide-Noticeable.jpg;Wide & Noticeable
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 9 Square Shape;https://www.instagram.com/p/-orDfcDtGp/;If you are on the early days for your first beard, the square cut would go a long way to give you masculinity that you see in grown adults. It does not have to be so difficult to have a small beard that will be a stunner to any girl that you have eyes for. You see, if you do not have the thick type of chin groove, you can have that petit spot which will usher you into nice guy looks.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Square-Shape.jpg;Square Shape
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 10 Tiny Billy;https://www.instagram.com/p/948tJ0JOQh/;You already know how great the he-Billy beard is. But do not be obsessed with it when you can have a simple fashion of it. A scar-like hair section is left at the small bend under your lower lip and that is all for the hair on and near your chin. The top lip is left thicker but it does not take away the credit of the tiny spot. That is beyond simple but you have the promise of excellent looks.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tiny-Billy.jpg;Tiny Billy
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 11 Groove-Around Lips;https://www.instagram.com/p/9pxfimpOSC/;You were wrong if you thought the long guise is for only those with extremely thick beards. You can have it for your short jowl hair and everybody will notice the superb finish you end up with. A dot-like blotch is all what is left at the low side while the top lips and the sideburns are making the impression of a celeb. It makes a groove over your top lip and it grows to the sides. You deserve what you get since you came all this far. For your next event, you will be the focal point and you will get questions about where you did your beard.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Groove-Around-Lips.jpg;Groove-Around Lips
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 12 Bushy;https://flic.kr/p/4pqFUm;Well, this may not be the 'bush' effect you may think at first but it is worthy such a name in all respects. It starts from the sideburns and comes down to make a round run over the chin. You can notice the small group of strands at hollow point under the lower jaw. It is intended to create a contrast to the bareness around the mouth and that effect turns out to be iconic.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Bushy.jpg;Bushy
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 13 Scruffy Spot;https://flic.kr/p/iYoD6;For the guy who does not have a place for sideburns and thick lower   (or you are just not comfortable with them), here is the promise of superiority. With the hair around lower and upper orifices given rough short edges, the thick part of lower lip's tiny hollow is left exuding prominence. You do not miss to impress the ladies and that is something many men would play along with.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Scruffy-Spot.jpg;Scruffy Spot
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 14 Long Sideburns;https://flic.kr/p/CcFBo;And here comes what you have been waiting for from the 'smalls' of the lower lip. Most of the details go to the sides but they end way before they come close to the end of the jawline. All over sudden, the chin becomes clear but not that thin line dropping at the center on top of the jaw's handle. It left as the point of attraction and if in a hasty gaze you can't miss it.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Long-Sideburns.jpg;Long Sideburns
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 15 Little Brown;https://www.instagram.com/p/9Em32cxmvE/;If you ever wished for facial hair that will not entirely belittle your haircut, little brown is a top style that will deliver that in an instance.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 16 Wild Long;https://www.instagram.com/p/88tH2KtdoJ/;Did anyone say that things never get long and wild here? He lied since you can see it all for yourself. With all the facial hair gone, you are left with the racy strands that go long. There is a keen intent to keep everything sparse and you can see each strand once a mild breeze passes over your face. You can't resist having such a fuzzing beard so make it your choice today.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Wild-Long.jpg;Wild Long
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 17 Oozing;https://www.instagram.com/p/8wC75oPKaE/;Leave the obsession of guys wanting to have lots of   on their faces.

You are right to make this choice and you will be the talk of town.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Oozing.jpg;Oozing
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 18 Thick Chin;https://www.instagram.com/p/8kNgfEiVo-/;Creating contrast between your head and facial hairstyle is a show of how your mastery for trendiness has grown over the years. It breaks the monotony and dominance of singularity. Thick chin has the potential to create distinction that will separate you from the mob of men who just have a cut for the sake of it. A short stout patch is left under the low jaw and it rises to connect with the sideburns.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Thick-Chin.jpg;Thick Chin
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 19 Young He-Goat;https://www.instagram.com/p/8d7O5PtADw/;There is never a better time to define your face hair style than when it is coming about. Young he-goat comes with the promise of taming your awn to look fresh. It is not long but adequate to cover the lower tip of the chin. You do not need to style it since leaving it natural gives its realness. Coupled up with your bowling hair on your head, you are stunningly handsome.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Young-He-Goat.jpg;Young He-Goat
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 20 Rounded Spotty;https://www.instagram.com/p/8HdB95JRne/;With your sideburns ending before they reach your cheeks, you would need something that would make them pass for an intention. Follow this up by clearing all the facial hair (of course sparing the eye lashes and brows). Only what remains is streak that goes along the bend of the lower lip but not any further than the curvy section.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rounded-Spotty.jpg;Rounded Spotty
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 21 Curvy Edges;https://www.instagram.com/p/7-0ZP1OZR-/;Having thick and long hair around you lips is tedious if you have to tend to it every other time. But wait! There is something creative you can do with it. What about trimming it to a flat and smooth bed style with sharp edges? This is what you are seeing here and it is startling. The under lip patch is groomed to an oval shape while the mustachio is inverted into thick bull horns. All the rest of mudpack hair is cleared out. This is the most brilliant style that you will ever come across in a while. There would be no blame if you make an instant decision to have it right away.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Curvy-Edges.jpg;Curvy Edges
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 22 Classic Spot;https://www.instagram.com/p/70IuozwdFM/;Your long face pack of hair does not have to be a bother every other morning you want to attend a serious event. It is like a tiny insect stuck under your lower lip surrounded by bleakness. The sides are shaped to a rough texture or if you want it smooth there is no harm done to the looks. Cute in every sense is what you would call it.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Classic-Spot.jpg;Classic Spot

You do not have to spend an arm and leg to give them that look. A dalliance simple awn would be effective as you can see with this guy.

Not in her right mind and that could be you if you chose such a cut.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dalliance-Simple.jpg;Dalliance Simple
http://machohairstyles.com/best-soul-patch-beard-styles/;# 24 Green Patchy;https://flic.kr/p/4NsHR9;Alright, you can tell that going wild with crazy colors can have such an impression on your looks. The beard is left to grow to a medium size and then straightened into finer strands. It is touched with a green dye and the results are just amazing.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 2 Swirling Effect; ;Not many people would notice that this is another cut from the hawk family. The short and flat landing top may deceive you but not after this. The sides are shaved to the skin as the longer top is styled into intricate backward swirls. This gives it an attractive appeal that you would feel superior in.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Swirling-Effect.jpg;Swirling Effect
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 3 Long Dropping Sides;https://www.instagram.com/p/_o1bpzkFxW/;If you are the kind of a guy that wishes to preserve the side mane untouched, here is your pick. With the top in medium size, it is given a spiky end at the front hairline. The sides are left long and coiffured in a bundle that fall over the neck region. It is a professional looking design and you can knock doors on all occasions knowing that you are 'cool'.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Long-Dropping-Sides.jpg;Long Dropping Sides
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 4 Baked Crown;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAJDN31Huda/;The lower sides up to the ears are shaved bare to act as the origin of the top crown. From the front, the hair is given a slight trim all the way down to the neckline. A brown-baked layer is added at the top and runs the same way to the neck. It is a cute guy look that will have heads turning everywhere you go.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Baked-Crown.jpg;Baked Crown
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 5 High &†Smooth;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAI_p1JP0r1/;Close skinned sides that are demarcated by a straight line where they end, are the humble foundation of the high top. The patch on the head crown is touched just a little and then finely combed towards the front. It is given a groovy turn at the forehead to form a 'cavy' impression. Both the front and back will leave you in awe and you cannot resist the temptation for one like this.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/High-Smooth.jpg;High & Smooth
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 6 Shy Mohawk;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAI1HWtQNZZ/;The name is coined from the fact that it is not a full   since the spike middle top only goes as far as the drop of the back head and ends in a tapered impression. The sides are cleanly shaven to leave not-so-wide patch that gives rise to the 'hawky' crown.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shy-Mohawk.jpg;Shy Mohawk
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 7 Finger-Comb Long;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAGVxsjIrnr/;Of all the styles you see here, this is one of the few that you will use your fingers to style it.

The sides are treated to a combination of styles as upper area is tapered while the lower is cleaned to show the skin.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Finger-Comb-Long.jpg;Finger-Comb Long
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 8 Fohawk Sweep;https://www.instagram.com/p/1175TULpyv/;You must be amazed with the creativity of this cut because you never believed you could have a   for the bubble family haircuts.

http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 9 Short &†Spiky;https://flic.kr/p/4MBrxP;No show of skin at the sides but they are flattened to create the typical look for a hawk top. The top is left to medium length and then done to form front running spikes. Simplicity is here and you can go to your serious events without any jitters.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Short-Spiky-1.jpg;Short & Spiky
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 10 Cute Black;https://flic.kr/p/9NgmBS;It brings out the handsomeness in your face by drawing away any hair strand to the forehead. The sides are finely combed backwards to form a lesser layer than the top. With only reserved combing, the top is tilted to the back but left vertical and with a spiky finish.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cute-Black.jpg;Cute Black
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 11 Furrowed Hawk;https://flic.kr/p/4uNY95;For those with sparse hair and want it in soft tone, you are at your best with this choice. The sides are designed to look like racing furrows and they move upwards. They give way to the craziness at the top which is long, racy and pointing to different directions. You are at your finest rocking look if this is what you choose for the forthcoming performance.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Furrowed-Hawk.jpg;Furrowed Hawk
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 12 Precise &†Bridged;https://flic.kr/p/2VQsW;Every strand on the top mop is in its place. The sides are brushed into a smooth texture to create a stark contrast with what is coming on the top. The bridged scenario is at the drop of the back head where the nape region and the head top patches are separated. It is an easy going cut that will not require much attention to remain intact.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Precise-Bridged.jpg;Precise & Bridged
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 13 Full Sides;https://flic.kr/p/9wunHZ;As opposed to many cuts from the faded hawk, this one goes against the grain to leave the sides covered. They are only touched to look like they are shorter so as to keep the attention on the top. The top patch is shaped as†curls at the tips and make backwards groove. You can go for your professional engagements with such an appearance and be noted for your trendiness.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Full-Sides.jpg;Full Sides
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 14 Crocodile Spine;https://flic.kr/p/7MqhsB;The entire hair is relaxed and oiled into a glossy appearance. The sides are cleared to leave the top as the dominating section. The middle bundles of the top are shaped into what appears as the scales of the spine of a crocodile. Girls will not miss to notice this and you will be their favorite.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Crocodile-Spine.jpg;Crocodile Spine
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 15 Girth Look;https://flic.kr/p/6YiUtq;Another type that spares the sides but this time they are combed towards the front to form a thick mop around the head. The top is lifted slightly to form an imitation of a Mohawk. You cannot deny that it is one of the best looks to redefine your sense of fashion.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Girth-Look.jpg;Girth Look
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 16 Tidy Top;https://flic.kr/p/7Muez1;The top section is formed from the ends of the sides and drawn to form a convergence at the middle of the head. The converged top ends in tips that form a tidy straight line of strands. It is simple and a definite catch for a young look.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tidy-Top.jpg;Tidy Top
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 17 Young Boys Style;https://flic.kr/p/afwsPr;You would be tempted to think that faux hawk fade cuts are meant for the big boys only. Definitely that is not true because even the small boys can have their own pick. The sides are drawn into a downward fall and where they begin marks the start of the top patch. It is combed upwards and brought together to form a thin confluence.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Young-Boys-Style2.jpg;Young Boys Style
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 18 Buzzing Back;https://www.instagram.com/p/BAKa_rtn54I/;The sides and back are cleared to the skin. The top is left with what looks like a military influenced patch but this one has more additions. Groups of strands from the opposite corners of the top are dragged towards the center but they do not make any contact. They leave a thin line in between.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Buzzing-Back.jpg;Buzzing Back
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 19 Messy Top with Bangs;https://www.instagram.com/p/_FOpbekFrq/;Just like their nature, bangs find their way into the faked Mohawk and the final results are impressive. The top is wide but left in a scattered formation. It looks rough but that is the intention. At the foreline, some short strands are dropped to point to the forehead but they only make a brief contact. You can tell its greatness if you are keen enough to see how each section complements each other.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Messy-Top-with-Bangs.jpg;Messy Top with Bangs
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 20 Extreme Thick;https://www.instagram.com/p/_U8ZrpSHTr/;There is a convention that the top of a hawk crown style is thin but the rules are redefined in the extreme thick haircut. With the sides trimmed to a shorter length, the top is left in a thickset. It is allowed to make natural waves which only add to the thickness that is a clear intention that the barber wanted to achieve.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Extreme-Thick.jpg;Extreme Thick
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 21 Rat Tail;https://www.instagram.com/p/-2V1iFDxmK/;This style drew so much fuzz in the 80s and it has remained strong for all these years but not without some upgrades. The sides are shaved while the back is designed to what looks like a rat tail. It is a beauty to behold since the edges are so concise and superbly done. The top grows wider and strands from the opposites sides come together to form a flat crisscross.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Rat-Tail.jpg;Rat Tail
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 22 Block Look;https://www.instagram.com/p/-TxzCkTEfu/;Cleared sides give way to a top that is shaped into a rectangle but with a higher front. The rise begins at the back neckline and grows gradually towards the frontline. At the forehead, it is grooved in an upward twist but makes an abrupt inward turn. For the guy who loves class, here is the promise to have it all.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Block-Look.jpg;Block Look
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 23 Cardinal Cap;https://www.instagram.com/p/8wHOEaGdqU/;Looking it from the front, you would notice a shape that looks like the popular cap worn by many ancient clerics. The top hair is grouped to have a pointed tip and wider base. The cap-like appearance is spoiled by the back that though shorter than the top makes a wide drop to the backline.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cardinal-Cap.jpg;Cardinal Cap
http://machohairstyles.com/best-faux-hawk-fade-haircuts/;# 24 Buzzing Short;https://www.instagram.com/p/uBzn2kQ1nY/;You can see the top patch buzzing in dominance. This effect has been created by what seems like rough tooth combs that did not finely style the hair. A clear cut line makes an outstanding separation with the sides. Around the top is a shaved mass that leaves the eye to focus on the short top-head buzz. If you do not have much time in your hands to keep retouching your hair every morning then here is how to have your way.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Buzzing-Short.jpg;Buzzing Short

You do not have to mess with where your bread comes from when the professional guy hairstyle can serve to your formal look.

It is a design for those who do not want a dull taste just because you have to impress your boss.;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Professional-Guy.jpg;Professional Guy

A short section of it goes to the back while the larger section moves to the front. At the division of the front and the back sections, a rift is formed and it seems like a neat division that was intended.

It starts at the top with a thick mop that fades as the fall goes down. At the beginning of the sides, it is trimmed to a smooth close cut and that is what creates the fading impact. The fade is given a curving impression which rises towards the front. It is a bewilderment to have such a cut.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Faded-Nape.jpg;Faded Nape

http://machohairstyles.com/eye-catching-bowl-cut-designs/;# 12 Mushroom Head;https://flic.kr/p/bcftCH;The serious guy is a definite catch among many guys. It is a serious look that would be perfect for your serious look. The fall begins at the top and gets around the head forming a thick girdle. The fall is trimmed to leave the face and ear clearly exposed. Simplicity is the underline for this style and you will like it to the last straw. It would be effective if you had no beards of whatever sort.†;http://machohairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mushroom-Head.jpg;Mushroom Head

Top with its wavy interlocked bundles is drawn downwards but only to go as far the middle of the sides. A front is given a shallow cave appearance with 3 bangs forming tri-bangs impression.
