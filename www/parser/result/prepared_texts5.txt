By curling777 short777 hair777 which often sticks to the head, you instantly transform your look777 and volumes it.

Why not add777 a777 few curls777 to mix777 it up777 too?";i:23378;s:495:"23378_%%%_ Okay, so this is a777 style for777 thin777 hair777 as well as thick777 hair777 but I'm including777 it because it's a777 style you should never overlook. Dip777 dying777 is great and can instantly transform your hair777 and change your look. You can go with a777 bold777 colour777 like777 Candice or if that's not really you then you can always go down777 the route of777 having a777 natural777 coloured777 dip777 dye. Don't be afraid to experiment and ask your stylist for777 advice.";i:23379;s:530:"23379_%%%_ Accessorising  is by far the easiest and quickest way777 to restyle your hair777 without any fuss. You can use hairbands, grips, or (my favourite777 choice) hats to change up777 your look. Hats look777 great with thick777 hair777 as your hair777 is less likely to go limp777 beneath them so you still keep your style. You don't have to have your hair777 braided777 like777 Candice to wear a777 hat777 either - why not experiment with tying your hair777 up, low777 buns, curls, and wearing777 your hair777 loose777 too?";i:23380;s:562:"23380_%%%_ The biggest problem I777 have with my thick777 hair777 is that it's always falling forward as it's so heavy, something that this style combats. By pinning777 half777 of777 your hair777 back777 you instantly change your look777 and reveal your pretty face777 to the world. You can use a777 number of777 different types to do this so be sure to choose the type that suits777 where you're headed best. Take Hayden777 for777 example: her777 glittery pins777 are perfect for777 the red777 carpet777 and really make777 her777 look777 like777 she777 belongs.";i:23381;s:639:"23381_%%%_ When you straighten thin777 hair777 it tends to go even thinner the second777 the heat777 touches it, often making777 it look777 incredibly limp777 and lifeless. For777 those of777 you with thick777 hair777 you won't have that problem however which means that the straight777 look777 is something you can really rock.  This look777 is perfect for777 any face777 shape777 and is also something that you can pull777 of777 casually, at a777 formal777 event, at work, on777 a777 night777 out777 - literally anywhere! It's smart, casual, and chic all in777 one. Plus, you'll love the shine777 straightening777 your hair777 gives it.";i:23382;s:526:"23382_%%%_ Central braids777 look777 fabulous at all times but especially if they're done on777 long, thick777 hair777 like777 Nina777 Dobrev777 has. They're a777 great choice for777 any face777 shape777 as you can alter them to include your bangs777 styles777 how best suits777 you. The biggest downside to them is that they're a777 nightmare to do singlehandedly so you may have to enlist the help of777 a777 friend or partner to create777 one777 for777 you. Other that that however they're a777 fabulous choice of777 style.";i:23383;s:728:"23383_%%%_ Long777 curls777 look777 great on777 thick777 hair777 because they have so much volume777 and texture. They tend to stay in777 longer777 than they would on777 thin777 hair777 too. The great thing about curls777 is you can alter them to be as large777 or small as you like777 which means you can adapt them to any face777 shape777 or occasion. I'd also like777 to point777 out777 J.Law's fabulous, soft777 fringe. She777 has a777 full777 fringe777 but it's been cut777 so it falls very softly and doesn't take over777 her777 look, something which thick777 hair777 can often do. If you're getting a777 fringe, try a777 one777 like777 this. One777 which looks777 grey777 but isn't too heavy777 due to your thick777 hair.";i:23384;s:795:"23384_%%%_ I'm not even sure where to begin when it comes to telling you why this style is fantastic. You only need to look777 at it to tell! Here Hilary777 is wearing777 her777 long777 hair777 in777 a777 half777 up777 do but has used a777 mixture of777 curls777 and waves777 to changer her777 style from prim and proper to a777 cross777 between a777 rock777 chick and boho, a777 unique combo. Note how not a777 single777 strand777 of777 her777 her777 hair777 is perfect, but yet because none777 of777 her777 hair777 is perfect it all looks777 pretty damn hot. I777 know, it's an odd thing to comprehend but you only need to look777 at her777 to know777 why this style works. If you're thinking777 of777 going for777 this style just remember to lock it in777 place with a777 little777 hairspray.";i:23385;s:692:"23385_%%%_ I777 always think medium777 length777 hair777 is a777 bit of777 an odd length777 as it's not really long777 enough to style yet it's long777 enough to need styling777 all the same. This style worn by Emma777 Watson is a777 great use of777 medium777 length777 hair777 and makes it love incredibly cute and elegant. Emma777 has curled777 her777 hair777 gently and pulled it back777 off777 of777 her777 face777 by securing a777 few strands777 with subtle777 pins. I777 also love how she's kept777 her777 bangs777 down777 on777 one777 side777 to frame777 her777 face, something you ought to experiment with to see what way777 your bangs777 should be worn to suit777 your face777 shape.";i:23386;s:522:"23386_%%%_ Your hairstyle777 doesn't need to be elaborate, in777 fact it can be incredibly simple777 and still look777 fabulous as Katy Perry shows us777 with her777 head777 of777 gently waves. Her777 waves777 are very subtle777 yet they add777 a777 new dimension777 and a777 layer777 of777 volume777 to her777 thick777 hair. This is a777 great style if you're looking for777 something quick777 and easy and one777 that's easily maintained throughout the day. Just add777 a777 bit of777 hairspray777 and you're good to go.";i:23387;s:510:"23387_%%%_ While Sophia777 Bush's fringe777 may look777 thick777 and heavy, it's actually an illusion due to the natural777 volume777 of777 her777 hair. Her777 look777 is created using minimal hair777 yet still looks777 gorgeous. This is a777 great tip if you're thinking777 of777 getting a777 full777 fringe. That said, full777 fringes don't tend to suit777 round faces777 so you may want to consider a777 different type of777 bangs. If you've got a777 delicate face777 shape777 however then jump right777 in!";i:23388;s:592:"23388_%%%_ Sometimes curling777 all of777 your hair777 can be too much for777 thick777 hair777 and adds777 too much volume777 however this style worn by Rachel777 McAdams is a777 great alternative. By just curling777 one777 half777 of777 her777 hair777 she777 creates a777 volumised look777 that's chic and classic777 yet without making777 her777 hair777 too big. This is a777 great style if you have a777 round face777 as it means you don't run the risk of777 making777 it look777 any rounder, though as you can see from Rachel777 McAdams it works for777 more delicate face777 shapes777 too.";i:23389;s:404:"23389_%%%_ Of777 course some people do suit777 having curls777 all over777 their head, especially if they have a777 delicate face777 shape. Hilarie Burton wore this style on777 One777 Tree777 Hill for777 years777 and had777 hoards of777 girls pining for777 her777 amazing style. This look777 works best on777 delicate faces777 and tends to stay in777 longer777 on777 people with medium777 length777 hair.";i:23390;s:522:"23390_%%%_ Remind me777 again why people with long, thick777 hair777 are even bothering to style their hair?777 Call me777 crazy, but I777 think the natural777 look777 really works, something which Miley777 proves to be true in777 this picture. Her777 long777 hair777 looks777 gorgeous and is full777 of777 volume777 as it's so thick. For777 days777 when you can't be bothered to style your hair777 don't fret - simply grab777 the hairbrush and head777 out777 the front777 door. You're sure to look777 fabulous either way.";i:23391;s:447:"23391_%%%_ I777 love Kiera's rough bob777 here. She777 looks777 so chic despite her777 hair777 being somewhat ragged, a777 style which really suits777 her. Note how her777 hair777 has no777 layers, making777 it look777 even thicker, something which you ought to do too if you're considering this style. This style is great for777 oval777 and heart777 shaped777 faces777 but it's not likely to suit777 people with square777 or round face777 shapes.";i:23392;s:507:"23392_%%%_ Low777 side777 buns777 are a777 fantastic choice for777 thick777 hair777 (the longer777 the better) as they're pretty quirky, fashionable, chic, and professional all in777 one. They work best on777 long777 thick777 hair777 as this makes for777 a777 bigger bun777 and in777 this case I777 say the unrulier the hair777 the better. You just have look777 at J.Law to see how well her777 messy777 side777 bun777 works so don't worry if you can't create777 the perfect side777 bun, it's no777 big deal.";i:23393;s:480:"23393_%%%_ I've seen women777 with thick777 and thin777 hair777 try the pixie777 cut777 and from experience I777 can tell you that the style works way777 better on777 thick777 hair777 as your look777 will still have a777 bit of777 life to it and won't end777 up777 clinging to your head. To make777 the most of777 this look777 you'll likely need to wash your hair777 daily (something I777 wouldn't normally advise) and steer clear of777 conditioner777 for777 the most part777 too.";i:23394;s:496:"23394_%%%_ Shoulder777 length777 curls777 is an incredibly classy style, as Miley777 shows off777 above. The good thing about having thick777 hair777 to do this style is that it makes your curls777 look777 even bigger, a777 big pro777 since it can be hard777 to create777 decent777 curls777 on777 this length777 of777 hair777 anyway. Also, take a777 look777 at Miley's cute, natural777 coloured777 dip777 dye.

Anne777 looks777 fantastic here and her777 hair777 is full777 of777 life. The only downside to having these super sized777 curls777 is that they won't work quite as well on777 round faces. While you can use curlers to create777 this look, I777 think that rollers are the most effect way777 to do this.";i:23396;s:542:"23396_%%%_ One777 of777 my favourite777 things about thick777 hair777 is how textured777 it is, something which Katy Perry's colour777 crazy look777 really makes the most of. By colouring777 your hair777 lots of777 different shades777 you really show off777 how thick777 it is and will wow people with your lucious locks. Don't worry if your'e not up777 from being as bright777 as Katy.

By simply adding a777 hairband like777 Emma777 Watson has done you stylishly combat this issue. Her's is a777 very subtle777 addition but you can be as flamboyant as you like. I777 love seeing headbands777 with flowers777 on777 them but it really depends on777 where you're headed and the tone777 of777 your day. The best way777 to choose a777 headband777 is to make777 it match777 your outfit.";i:23398;s:470:"23398_%%%_ Low777 buns777 are great and incredibly stylish too. You'll be pleased to hear777 that they're much easier to create777 than low777 side777 buns777 too. When you're setting your bun, try to make777 it about the same height as J. Laws - any lower777 and it will likely brush777 on777 any high777 necked clothes777 you're wearing777 and will probably fall777 out777 prematurely.

It looks777 amazing swept777 back777 of777 her777 face, a777 style you can create777 easily simply by blow-drying your hair777 into777 the desired position. A777 few short777 layers777 really add777 to this look777 but be sure not to overdo it or your hair777 won't look777 as thick777 as you'd like777 it too.

That's the great thing about thick777 hair777 however, you don't need much to make777 an impact. This is a777 style that definitely works best if you have long777 hair777 as it means all the hair777 you've pinned777 back777 will fall777 beautifully down777 your back. You could also try straightening777 or curling777 your hair777 to add777 to this style.";i:23403;s:492:"23403_%%%_ You don't need many but a777 few highlights777 (preferably coloured) will go a777 long777 way777 to brightening up777 your hair. By adding highlights777 to thick777 hair777 you automatically give the illusion of777 more volume, something which Nina777 proves here. Also, by curling777 her777 hair777 it makes this look777 even better and makes her777 look777 classy, casual, professional and chic all at the same time.

The great thing about a-line777 styles777 is that they suit777 any face777 shape777 and you can have your bangs777 tapered777 to look777 even better. Ask your stylist what length777 is good for777 you and how they recommend you wear you bangs777 - my personal advice is that if you have a777 round face777 go with long777 bangs777 and the slimmer777 the face777 the shorter777 they can be.";i:23407;s:495:"23407_%%%_ Thin777 hair777 is renowned for777 looking limp777 but with all the styling777 options777 these days777 that need no777 longer777 be the case.

Instead she777 winds up777 looking elegant, chic, sassy, and oh777 so stylish. This is perhaps her777 best look! Plus, this style works really well as she's so short.

The biggest problem with being outdoors so much however is that you'll find your hair777 all too often gets tangled from being exposed to the wind.

The overall effect doesn't have to be quite as precise and it doesn't matter if some curls777 and waves777 are smaller than others. By pulling some strands777 back777 like777 Hilary777 Duff777 you're exposing your face777 more, allowing you to get a777 summer777 glow, and you're adding to the rock777 chick style.
