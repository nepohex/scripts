<h3>#3: Short, Black, and Choppy</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">The wonderful side effect that accompanies short haircuts is the attention they draw to your whole look. A choppy pixie reveals your inner sassy girl. Itâs fun, playful, sexy and low maintenance. What else could you expect from a cut?</p>&#13;

<p style="text-align: left;">Short haircuts for black women are stylish and appealing even in their shortest lengths. The feathered pieces settle well and create a vision of textured flawlessness.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/5-pixie-hairstyle-for-black-women.jpg?w=500" alt="Pixie Hairstyle For Black Women" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_knpMvhjvt/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;

<h3>#6: Curly Pixie Haircut</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Hereâs another cute pixie variety to add to the stock of classy black women hairstyles. This curly style is neat and discreet, but it oozes good taste and sophistication.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11-black-curly-pixie.jpg?w=500" alt="Black Curly Pixie" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/2JoWyaDl7Q/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#7: Black Beauty</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">This style gives the âJersey Bumpâ a run for its money. While not as extreme as the famed âbumpâ, this fluff takes a typical African American hairstyle and adds a little flavor. Accomplish this by fluffing the back of your crown. Whip it real good.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12-disheveled-pixie-for-thick-hair.jpg?w=500" alt="Disheveled Pixie For Thick Hair" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BAspvqnDl93/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#8: Spiral Ombre Hairstyle</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">The look right here gives a new meaning to âfiery.â The blonde spirals offer the flame effect encouraged by the glorious texture. Get to your hair stylist and have her layer your locks, girl.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13-two-tone-short-curly-hairstyle.jpg?w=500" alt="Two Tone Short Curly Hairstyle" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBqSV14AoaH/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#9: Short Maroon Tresses</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Not only is the style spunky, the color sets you apart from other black women. Short hairstyles with a tapered silhouette are popular among African American beauties with thick hair. If you have a similar cut, why not visit the barber and get him to refresh your look by lining you up?</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14-short-tapered-hairstyle-for-black-women.jpg?w=500" alt="Short Tapered Hairstyle For Black Women" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/2HakolhjpN/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#10: Rosewood Ombre Hairstyle</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">The days of subtle highlights are gone with the wind. Bring out the color of your skin tone with an exquisite rosewood dye job. Also, keep them guessing with a side swept bang â they donât need to know whatâs behind that veil. Not yet.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9-African-American-asymmetrical-bob.jpg?w=500" alt="African American Asymmetrical Bob" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_Qg2-3hjsl/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#11: Black Curls of Softness</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Short hairstyles for black women can vary in texture and type â in this example we see soft, controlled curls that are obtained through a hair relaxer followed by hot rollers or a large barreled curling iron.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1-curly-black-pixie.jpg?resize=500%2C507" alt="Curly Black Pixie" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/87GcfYjlwk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#12: Short Dramatic Edging</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Beautiful hair isnât always sweet and orderly â if you like a bit of an edge to your style, why not add some actual edges? This hairdo features a long, pointed tip at the nape of the neck, as well as curved edges at the ear line and choppy layers up top.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2-short-black-haircut-with-highlights.jpg?resize=500%2C500" alt="Short Black Haircut With Highlights" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/-7NMS2LWPk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;

<h3>#13: Varied Lengths for Short Hair</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Black hair styles are too clichÃ© at times â so next time you visit your salon, go for something more sophisticated and modern. This curly âdo brings some overall softness without the hassle of long or high maintenance hair.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/3-african-american-curly-messy-pixie.jpg?resize=500%2C576" alt="African American Curly Messy Pixie" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BB41wKDPWmq/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#14: Front and Forward</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Show off your assertive side with this sassy cut that trumps all other short black hairstyles. Get your hair relaxed or go with a stylish short weave to get this soft yet not-too-curly look that will give you confidence each and every day.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/4-choppy-black-pixie-haircut.jpg?resize=500%2C500" alt="Choppy Black Pixie Haircut" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/6X-nkuLWCj/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#15: Short Hairstyle for Thin Hair</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">For every black girl with thick hair, there are several ones with thin, weaker strands. Short styles can give thinner locks a boost and look just as lovely as long hair.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/5-sideparted-pixie-bob-for-black-women.jpg?resize=500%2C500" alt="Side-Parted Pixie Bob For Black Women" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BCQfN99KzUg/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#16: Embracing Short Natural Curl</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Going natural is very popular right now with black women, but sometimes it isnât realistic for all. It requires a lot of maintenance and isnât always very functional for certain vocations. If you love the idea of natural hair but struggle to sport it yourself, go for a short and cropped version like this cute style.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/6-african-american-side-part-pixie.jpg?resize=500%2C524" alt="African American Side Part Pixie" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_h-pleTbSj/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;

<h3>#17: Faux Hawk Inspired Short Haircut</h3>&#13;

<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/7-black-mohawk-pixie-hairstyle.jpg?resize=500%2C500" alt="Black Mohawk Pixie Hairstyle" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/-6d2NcNUtc/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#18: Color Pop on Short Hair</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Say goodbye to short hair that follows the rules â todayâs black females love to mix it up with both bold styles and colors. This color contrast of a deep burgundy and a more attention-getting orange will light up any room.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/8-african-american-short-undercut-for-women.jpg?resize=500%2C525" alt="African American Short Undercut For Women" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9OjGH6jl4l/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;

<h3>#20: Perfectly Coifed Short Black Hair</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">A modern take on 1950s haircuts, this is one example of the sophisticated hairstyles for black women that are available from todayâs stylists. The hair is relaxed and then cut at an angle thatâs just long enough to be tucked behind the ear. A stylish swoop of front bangs brightens the eyes.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10-sleek-black-bob-hairstyle.jpg?resize=500%2C515" alt="Sleek Black Bob Hairstyle" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BGdeuYVoGCK/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#21: Short and Silver</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Black women transform into silver foxes when hair is colored platinum blonde with a hint of metallic shine. Black short hair doesnât have to commit to a homegrown color â think outside of the box and go grey, silver or white for a fun new take on life.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11-ash-blonde-pixie-bob-for-black-women.jpg?resize=500%2C543" alt="Ash Blonde Pixie Bob For Black Women" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BFXM9UwpNTH/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;

<h3>#39: Raven Haircut</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Short black hairstyles are probably no less versatile than longer âdos. You canât complete much of braiding with this length, but when it comes to texture, you may try spikes, curls, waves, feathers, and look different each time!</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/8-spiky-black-pixie.jpg?w=500" alt="Spiky Black Pixie" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/73x16oOC6_/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;

&#13;
<h3>#42: Purple and Gold</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Light golden brown is a very soft and delicate color that flatters medium skin tones. Some women think itâs too subtle, but you can always spice things up with a temporary color, like this pastel purple, for instance, or any other shade of your choice. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15940" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/19-short-layered-bob-for-African-American-women.jpg?w=500" alt="short layered bob for African American women" class="wp-image-15940" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/8cJDlQkEIE/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#43: Chocolate Caramel Swirl</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the best color combos for black short haircuts is caramel and chocolate because they blend well together and they warm and brighten golden brown complexions. Make sure to keep your roots dark so that the color looks good even when your cut grows out. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15939" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/18-curly-top-short-hairstyle-for-black-women.jpg?w=500" alt="curly top short hairstyle for black women" class="wp-image-15939" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/7-4NE3pCfN/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#44: Shapely Waves</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the best ways to add body to hairstyles for black women, especially those with relaxed hair, is with a heavy dose of texture. Itâs best to keep your hair dark because solid black hair is better able to show off every curve in your waves. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15935" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/15-short-black-wavy-hairstyle.jpg?w=500" alt="short black wavy hairstyle" class="wp-image-15935" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/4kvCf8PIsY/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#45: Strike a Pose</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Muted golden blonde hair looks ravishing on black ladies because it picks up on the warm undertones in their complexion. Some of the best complementary shades are the ones with gold and bronze bases. Make sure to style a bright and bold look to compliment those statement-making shades. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15927" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/7-dark-blonde-curly-hairstyle-for-black-women.jpg?w=500" alt="dark blonde curly hairstyle for black women" class="wp-image-15927" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/7ILapwH9uB/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#46: Spirited Spirals</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the easiest ways to achieve defined curls within short haircuts for black women is by using flexi-rods. While many hot curling irons may be too big to style tight ringlets, the rods can easily cope with the task. Bold magenta accents will make them really stand out. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15926" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/6-short-curly-hairstyle-for-African-American-women.jpg?w=500" alt="short curly hairstyle for African American women" class="wp-image-15926" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/8WaLX7hTN7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#47: Beautiful Arched Bangs</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">A bob with bangs will always be a classic and stylish cut. But, if you want to make your look truly exciting, try upgrading it with bold makeup. Multi-colored eye shadow and pretty purple lips will surely do the trick. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15925" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/5-layered-bob-with-long-straight-bangs.jpg?w=500" alt="layered bob with long straight bangs" class="wp-image-15925" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/67kblJImo5/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#48: Waves of Amber</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the queens of âslayingâ a short haircut is none other than Rihanna. Because of this, she constantly serves as inspiration for women flocking to a stylistâs chair. This swirled style in a vibrant reddish-brown tone is one of the singerâs best and most popular looks. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15930" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10-chestnut-brown-short-curly-hairstyle.jpg?w=500" alt="chestnut brown short curly hairstyle" class="wp-image-15930" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/8dYHd7Q1FH/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#49: Fabulous Faux Hawk</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">A Mohawk is always an edgy and exciting look–but letâs be honest–itâs not for everyone. It takes a lot of guts to shave your head to achieve the full look. Plus, it doesnât flatter everyone. A faux option gives the similar effect without the serious commitment. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15931" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/11-short-black-fauxhawk-for-women.jpg?w=500" alt="short black fauxhawk for women" class="wp-image-15931" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/6U-r3szDul/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#50: Striped and Short</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Black and white patterns usually conjure up memories of a zebra, but within black women hairstyles it can look surprisingly fresh and cool. This is perfect for mature women who are going grey and want to sport a hairstyle that looks appropriate, quite natural and stylish at the same time. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15932" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/12-short-layered-black-pixie-with-blonde-feathers.jpg?w=500" alt="short layered black pixie with blonde feathers" class="wp-image-15932" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/8J2l07uBbR/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#51: Red Ringlets</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Naturally curly short black hair needs a cut that provides a shape and structure to the tendrils. By having it tapered towards the neck, you can maintain a cropped look, but still have a nice length above. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15933" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/13-short-red-perm-hair.jpg?w=500" alt="short red perm hair" class="wp-image-15933" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/5-xEv6OKrJ/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#52: Vintage Vision</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Pixie cuts are great because they have the ability to look classy or edgy depending on how you style them. This look veers more towards polished because of its vintage inspired texture; ideal for a woman who enjoys drawing inspiration from the past decades.</p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15934" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/14-short-black-haircut.jpg?w=500" alt="short black haircut" class="wp-image-15934" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/8dZFnJw1HO/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#53: Cutie with Curls</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Ladies with round faces may be apprehensive about sporting cropped cuts because of the fear that they will look wide. To prevent this, even out your hairdo by keeping the middle long. It will add an extra height and instantly slim your visage. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15924" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/4-long-top-short-sides-natural-hairstyle-for-women.jpg?w=500" alt="long top short sides natural hairstyle for women" class="wp-image-15924" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/8HVEzUCKVq/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#54: Chocolate Chin-Length Cut</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">An angled bob is a good choice for women with chemically straightened hair because it provides fullness, thickness and a beautiful silhouette. Incorporating a deep heavy side bang keeps it modern, but it also pulls double duty by helping to elongate faces. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15937" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/17-chocolate-brown-layered-bob.jpg?w=500" alt="chocolate brown layered bob" class="wp-image-15937" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/8Q7pVutfXZ/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#55: Modern Mohawk</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Some of the most swoon-worthy short hairstyles for black women feature a balance of design elements. Incorporating equal parts of rocker and chic, this look is the perfect blend of hard and soft for a memorable and high fashion hairstyle. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15923" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/3-short-natural-fauxhak-for-women.jpg?w=500" alt="short natural fauxhak for women" class="wp-image-15923" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/6x8BKfRP6j/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#56: Dramatic Designs</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">When you are rocking an undercut, it can be hard to incorporate interesting elements while wearing the same exact style every day. The key is to work with color and designs to create a unique look. The best part is that you can easily dye or grow out your hair for a completely different hairdo the next time around. </p>&#13;
<div id="attachment_15921" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1-short-blonde-afro-undercut-for-women.jpg?w=500" alt="short blonde afro undercut for women" class="wp-image-15921" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://instagram.com/p/4EeGl5xP-r/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;
&#13;
<h3>#57: Short Black Round Curled Pixie</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">Short hair is not an excuse to stop your styling experiments with beautiful and unusual hair textures. These tight circular curls remind round brushstrokes which look amazing with the high shine finish. Something like this can be easily pulled off with a length of a short pixie.</p>&#13;
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/therighthairstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/57-African-American-curly-pixie.jpg?resize=500%2C510" alt="African American Curly Pixie" data-recalc-dims="1"/><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BF7MOa7R0Fk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Source</a></p></div>&#13;

&#13;
<h3>#59: Black Funky Tricolor Pixie</h3>&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">If a chic texture isnât just enough for you, resort to the great potential of modern hair color. Mixing natural black, chocolate brown and golden blonde via the most popular today balayage coloristic technique creates a black short hair style thatâs anything but common.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<h3>#60: Tousled Pixie With Layered Bangs</h3>&#13;

&#13;
<p style="text-align: left;">While choosing a proper hairstyle for yourself, take into consideration the fact that it is a challenging and time-consuming process. If you are not absolutely sure as to what to choose, you should better consult your stylist, ask family and friends, look through different magazines, etc. Then your choice will be perfect. Stay beautiful and elegant!</p>&#13;
